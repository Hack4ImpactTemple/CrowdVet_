Most countries are unlikely to connect their entire populations to grid for years, if not decades. In Uganda, only 20% of the population has access to electricity divided between 8% rural and 70% urban energy access. Off-grid power solutions enable families to improve basic living conditions and provide the spark for economic opportunity.  Economic impact According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), this is manifested in 3 ways; as a change in household expenditure, as a change in income generation and through increased employment. Additionally, there are long term benefits that could accrue at the household level if savings are diverted to activities that lead to better health and educational outcomes. By organsising the solar industry data Remot will be transformational as the industry will be more attractive  for funders and investors.  Health impact Through reduced kerosene use for lighting, through electrification of health care centers and through a reduction in expenditure that can lead to increased spending on food and through it to better nutritional outcomes. Remote solar monitoring further helps reduce downtime of solar systems in health centres thus saving millions of lives a year.  Impact on education Increased education and time for income generating activities; lighting at home directly impacts women’s literacy (UNDP). Brazil census data shows that girls in rural areas access to electricity are 59% more likely to complete their primary education by the time they are 18 than those who do not have lighting at home. Increased access to information through appliances powered by solar home systems; Study hours are extended to night and morning preps and more equipment and teaching material such as computers are useable. Increased communication abets facets of empowerment. A survey by M-KOPA found that 47% of customers bought a TV to access news or educational materials and 70% felt more informed and politically aware. A study in rural India showed that women who had access to cable TV had lower tolerance for spousal abuse, lower son preference, more autonomy and greater likelihood of sending girls to school.","Renewable Energy (e.g. solar)","Clean Energy and Power; ICT","Douglas","Karugaba Baguma","Male","10-13-1990","Unreasonable Institute","Innovex participated in the 2018 ten-months accelerator run by Unreasonable East Africa.We are now part of their alumni support program through which we continue to access mentorship, tools and knowledge needed to grow the company.  ","https://www.sautitech.com/startups/innovex-uganda-bags-shs37m-in-cisco-global-ict-face-off/  https://cisco.innovationchallenge.com/cisco-global-problem-solver-challenge-2019/winners  http://pctechmag.com/topics/innovex-uganda/","UGX","109,000,000","88,000,000","No","Revenue generating","10000","12","2","We need a lead time of 2 months to ship materials needed to assemble the solar remote monitoring devices that we sell to solar companies.","Quarterly","A  loan of $10,000 helps innovex increase its inventory of remote monitoring units for solar home systems and solar equipment and serve 500 more households.","Inventory-$10,000  All funding will be used to buy and ship materials for assembling solar remote monitoring devices","We sell remote monitoring devices to solar companies.

We aim for as much processing to happen as close to the farm as possible; Goodel works with farmers and processors to do most of that work themselves, helping to build more vibrant rural communities.   We also improve supply chain transparency and communication by ensuring that coffee buyers know all of their partners. We work collaboratively with coffee producers and processors as completely as possible, developing agreements to share cost and revenue information as well as profits with our partners, and also agree on a percentage of profits to be reinvested in the producing communities. We also use our knowledge and market position to mitigate some of the financial risk that is usually borne by farmers. The more shipments we can finance, the more producers we can reach.   PT Goodel Skylove Indonesia creates better social outcomes at three levels: coffee processors, producers, and international buyers.  Working with our processor partners, we increase the value of the producers' coffee and at the same time ensure that farmers receive a higher proportion of that value by aligning financial incentives through transparent profit-sharing. We insist that as much processing as possible happens in the farming community, increasing employment opportunities in rural communities, particularly for women. We help farmers to understand how their practices impact coffee quality and price, and to promote the adoption of sustainable practices and reinvestment in farms and communities.  We work directly with coffee processors, including collectors and mill owners, to improve coffee quality and traceability. We build a culture of shared knowledge and transparent operations that allow us to share profits, helping to decentralize market power structures and empower marginalized supply chain actors.  We work with coffee buyers to improve their knowledge of the intricacies of the local market, in particular the power structures that govern the division of financial and social capital. We establish genuine traceability systems that are transparent to all participants and independently verifiable so buyers can be sure that their purchases directly benefit farmers and rural livelihoods. We nurture meaningful and long term direct relationships with communities to improve the financial and ecological viability of individual family farms and promote investment in producing communities.","Agriculture","Agricultural Products and Services; Community Development","Sak","Lee","Male","10-14-1987","","","","IDR, USD","$150,000","$140,000","No","Profitable","50000","3","3 months","The time required for purchasing coffee, drying + processing, hand sorting, pre-shipment sample approval, export documentation, export and then receiving the payment can take up to 3 months.","Monthly repayment schedule.

The loan will finance about 50% of the invoice value, and the loan will be used specifically and only to finance confirmed contracts (invoice financing) from reliable and reputable buyers.","Financing the purchase of the raw material for coffee requires over USD100,000. This is a big hurdle for most producers, as they cannot get a loan of this size from banks.   Goodel has already partnered with several coffee processors/suppliers around Indonesia that produce high quality  specialty coffee but are unable to export due to financing issues. Goodel has already found buyers who are willing to buy their coffee. With this loan Goodel will be able to help these processors export their coffee.  With Goodel's current capacity, we are unable to meet the demands of several processors at a time. This loan will be crucial to kickstart our project and will result in increased sales revenue by multiple folds.","Since the loan will be used to finance confirmed contracts, and the turnaround time from the purchase of coffee to export is approximately 2~3 months, Goodel will be able to pay back the loan in full after the payment is made from the buyer.","No","","","","","","",""

In order to give you an insight of our work in the field of community Development, we have been instrumental in initiating several successful community projects  that are a living example to this day, in terms of impacting positively in the lives of the village dwellers at the grass-roots level, be it at the rural set ups or urban slum areas. For example, the Kisesini community health facility in arid and semi arid region in Kamaba land in rural Kenya is one of such initiatives. As the craftswomen on the ground will testify to you, their dream health facility project had  stalled for 20 years; but when they brought their problem to our attention, we were able to use our networks in making their dream project become a reality.  Thank you to the American Medics who joined hands with us in enabling the community health project become a reality. This happened after my sharing with them the plight of the villagers while on a visit to USA as a key note speaker at the invitation of some American Universities, Church, NGOs, and trading partners etc. The health facility is this day serving over 75 villages. 150 community Health workers (CHWs) thus 2 (CHWs)from each village have been trained on primary health care etc and they are today serving as volunteers in their respective villages. Each of the (CHWs) have a bicycle to facilitate their movement in the region. The branding of the Bicycles was done at the www.craftofafrica.org place.   Team spirit is key to the success of any community based project initiative, with that in mind, we had to bring on board all the relevant Government authorities in the ministry of health among other players in the region as a way of making this project a success story.  As a result of our track record on matters development at the grass-roots, the Asian Hindu community in Kenya, did approach us too, and this day our sister organization www.peopletopeopletourism.com, have joined hands with the Hindu community, and we are already involved in several  primary sectors activities ticked in this form. There is still room for doing more in terms of impacting on peoples lives through income generating activities that have the potential for job creation.

This is practically possible because each vehicle will be generating a daily income of Ksh 3,000/= thus multiplied by 8 vehicles = ksh24,000/= times 20 days = 480,000/=.   If you Multiply 480,000/= times 12 months, you will find that the business will have generated Ksh 5,760,000/=.   Based on the above facts/tabulations, we will be able to generate enough resources from the business to pay the KIVA loan of USD$50,000 in 12 month without fail or any default whatsoever...........!!!!  NB: We have made our calculations based on 20 days a month income of Ksh 480,000 because we will need to create room/days for  vehicle servicing and any required repairs that a vehicle may need in a week or in a month. This is in every sense of the word very realistic, and we are very optimistic that paying KIVA loan is possible in the period indicated above.","Buying of the 8 fleet 5L Toyota Shark vehicles for public transport business service","As noted above, will buy 8 Toyota Shark 5L models.

This will mean creating  around 20 jobs. i.e thus for 8 jobs for drivers, 8 conductors/taunts, a project manager, a few mechanics to service the vehicles as well as generating more jobs as the business expands and solidifies.","In overall, each  vehicle will ""DAILY"" bring in i.e generate KSH 3,000/=  per day. This is the case after paying all the days' expenses. e.g Daily driver's allowance/salary and the taunts/conductor's, and the daily cooperative society Sacco  daily contributions of ksh 500/= and other expenses. At some point, we can also borrow from the Matatu Transport Sacco once we accumulate enough shares.  In short, our daily income of ksh 24,000/= per month from the money generated from the 8 vehicles is what we will set aside daily to monthly pay the KIVA loan. As noted above, each vehicle will generate ksh3,000/= per day, thus multiplied by 8 vehicles, the total amount generated at the end of the day will be ksh 24,000/= . Thus multiplied buy 20 days in a month, we will raise ksh480,000/= multiplied by 12 month, we will generate ksh5,760,000/= This kind of revenue is good enough to re-pay KIVA loan in a year and still keep the business running to support our other lines of business, be it in the crafts-world and in the Tourism front etc.","As articulated/tabulated above, we will be able to daily generate an income of ksh24,000/=  from the 8 Toyota Shark  5 L models public vehicles. If you multiply ksh24,000/=  by 20 days, the amount to be generated monthly will be to a tune of ksh480,000/=, Times 12 months or 1 year, we will have raised ksh 5,760,000.

Acceso sources fruits and vegetables and fish and seafood products from 1,100+ smallholder farmers and fishers from the Andean, Pacific, and Caribbean regions and sells the products directly to Grupo Éxito, Jeronimo Martins, Olimpica, Sodexo, and other large, quality buyers. Farmers that transact with Acceso benefit from technical assistance to ensure they meet market needs (quality standards, production levels, safety requirements, and others), fair prices, cash payments, and sustainable access to quality markets which improves their livelihoods. Buyers benefit from competitive prices, high product quality, and the opportunity to impact low-income communities by purchasing local products. The improved value chain connecting producers and buyers boosts the local economy.","Social impact is embedded into Acceso’s core business operations through its continual, direct sourcing from smallholder farmers and fishers. The business has trained more than 1,500 producers and has impacted the lives of more than 9,000 people including farmers’ workers and family members. Acceso’s technical assistance and direct market linkages have helped to generate more than $4.2m in cumulative income for these farmers and fishers as of 2017. Acceso’s goal is not only to improve farmers and fishers’ livelihoods and to lift them out of poverty but to train and empower them to become entrepreneurs who are sustainable in their own right.    Additionally, Acceso has created local jobs for employees at the management level, on the technical assistance team, and in its warehouses (directly) and for Acceso service providers through logistics and other services (indirectly). Additionally, Acceso’s 5 community collection and processing centers provide jobs and economic opportunities for rural communities where Acceso operates.","Agriculture","Agricultural Products and Services; Aquaculture and Fisheries","","","","","ANDE; Clinton Foundation","The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP), an initiative of the Clinton Foundation, is a social business builder that brings entrepreneurial solutions to global poverty.

For example, in the last few years Boyacá has been at the center of major trucker union strikes which have disrupted several main roads in Colombia. This has led to unforeseen delays in deliveries and increased logistics costs.","Full repayment at 12 months","A loan of $50k will provide Acceso with the working capital to implement an improved (quicker) payment scheme to its network of 1100+ farmers.","The rural sector in Colombia has historically been abandoned and remains mostly disconnected from the major economic networks of the country. Smallholder farmers in war-torn rural areas lack the adequate technical skills, know-how, tools and working capital to improve their yields and crop quality, and access quality markets. Smallholder farmers with little to no information about, or proximity to end-markets that will pay them a fair price for their products are vulnerable to predatory intermediaries who transact in the informal market. Though these intermediaries pay farmers below market prices, they are able to make same day payments because they operate in informal markets with no regard to market pricing or quality control standards. This means that smallholder farmers become accustomed to instant payments for their products even if it means receiving below market payments. Additionally, these market connections are volatile and farmers receive minimal value.  Acceso incorporates smallholder farmers into the formal market (through selling produce directly to large local retailers and supermarkets including Exito, Jeronimo Martins, Sodexo, and Olimpica) and ensures farmers are paid fair market prices for their products. However, these robust market linkages require working capital to facilitate timely payments to farmers. Formalizing transactions and incorporating farmers to formal markets also requires strict operational and financial processes that impede Acceso from making instantaneous payments to farmers. Some of these processes and procedures include invoices with clear payment terms and dates, product sorting, and pricing according to different quality criteria (e.g. top-quality products are paid at a premium), and quality control and inventorying. In 2017, Acceso purchased 4.4 million kg of product from smallholder farmers. It takes Acceso 8-10 business days to pay farmers from the moment product is collected due to the formal procedures described above while on average it can take up to 37 business days for Acceso to receive payment from its buyers. This creates a working capital constraint for the business.  Acceso is seeking a $50k Kiva loan to improve its working capital position which will allow Acceso to purchase more produce from its network of  farmers and become more efficient operationally. With greater working capital, Acceso will also be able to test the extent to which it can reduce payment days to farmers and how that increases business revenues (and subsequently farmer incomes) through increased crop purchases. Acceso is aiming to give partial payment on the same day products are collected from farmers. The benefit is that instead of having to wait 10 business days for full payment, farmers can receive part of what is owed to them on the same day that Acceso picks up their products. Additionally, this will allow farmers to have cash in hand to cover their expenses such as paying farm workers or reinvesting in their farm more quickly, while alleviating working capital constraints for Acceso.","This loan will alleviate Acceso’s short term working capital constraints and allow Acceso to continue connecting farmers with quality markets by purchasing more crops from farmers and facilitating quicker payments to farmers for their produce. This means that farmers will be able to more quickly reinvest in their farms and become more productive. When farmers become more productive, they are able to sell higher crop volumes to Acceso which in turn allows Acceso to increase the volumes sold to its buyers and generate more revenue.","Acceso has shown significant growth in revenue as a result of higher volumes traded with key clients such as Grupo Exito and continued diversification of its portfolio of products. In addition to strong revenue growth, Acceso’s gross and EBITDA margins have also steadily improved since its launch, demonstrating gains in operational efficiency and strong supplier and buyer relationships. We estimate that Acceso will reach revenues of $4.1m in 2019 which represents an increase of 32% in sales from 2018 to 2019.","Yes","","","","COP 80,000,000 ","21.87% APR","Bancolombia",""

We do so using a proprietary curriculum-based training program called the KadAfrica Experience. By equipping girls with the land, knowledge, skills and assets to begin their own sustainable passion fruit farms, they become financially literate, entrepreneurial leaders generating income through agribusiness. Girls progress through a fun, integrated 1.5-year program alongside their peers and families, becoming well-equipped to both make and afford responsible decisions for themselves and their children—breaking the poverty cycle and building more prosperous, and equal communities. Each family receives 10 seedlings for their homestead so that they can earn and learn from their daughters and are vested in their continued attendance and success.   KadAfrica purchases 100% of girls’ fruit which we bulk, grade and transport for wholesale, and by the end of 2018, processing into concentrate fruit pulp. Through our inclusive, girl-powered value chain, KadAfrica is able to produce the highest quality passion fruit product, at a consistent price, year-round.","By forming girls into passion fruit growing cooperatives and providing them with life-skills, sexual/reproductive health knowledge, and a toolkit to become community change makers, these previously unemployed young women become active advocates able to catalyze village level change. To date, over 2,100 girls have participated in the KadAfrica Experience. KadAfrica has created 41 fruit farming cooperatives, facilitating access to 130+ acres of land on which each girl gets an individual plot to generate protected earnings. Beyond gaining skills to cultivate export quality fruit, our girl farmers see an increase in income of more than $215 per year—this translates to an increase in agriculture productivity of more than $2,100 per acre. On average, a cooperative will save $1000+ within a year of joining our program; girls report that they save 75% more through their savings group and 92% have accessed loans. 96% of girls note they have now set goals for themselves and 100% feel capable of achieving them. Additionally, 90% of girls note that after learning about menstrual hygiene management and how to make reusable sanitary pads from locally available materials, that they now have regular access to menstrual hygiene products and 95% state that they have the confidence, knowledge and resources to address health-related issues.","Agriculture","Agricultural Products and Services; Community Development; Education","","","","","Ashoka; ANDE; Acumen; GSBI; Unreasonable Institute"," -2017 Santa Clara University Miller Center Global Social Benefit Incubator Graduate.  -Founder Eric Kaduru is a 2015 Acumen East Africa Fellow.  -Both founders are 2014 Unreasonable East Africa Fellows  Eric Kaduru was selected as the entrepreneur representative at the ANDE 2018 Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Convening.

Our mission is to connect chocolate lovers in temperate regions of the world to the tropical farmers we partner with to source the incredible ingredients used in the products we produce. Additionally, despite 20+ years of organic and fair trade premiums being paid to smallholder farmers — many are still living in poverty. We are actively working to solve this problem by providing market access and financial premiums above and beyond commodity market rates and what is guaranteed by third party certification systems. In addition to quality premiums, we are working towards developing premium programs to compensate farmers for implementing principles like agroforestry and regenerative agricultural practices. We envision a future where farmer prosperity & ecological stewardship are intrinsically linked to the enjoyment of chocolate worldwide.","Our main areas of work include:  Compostable Packaging in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) Industry I am committed to innovating in compostable materials for 100% of the packaging used by the company. Creating new forms of compostable packaging that are cost effective is incredibly time consuming, involving management and oversight of multiple stakeholders, from film producers, to laminators, to printers, and finally to packaging equipment manufacturers. I manage all of this in an open source manner, sharing data and insights with anyone else interested in putting scalable compostable materials into the CPG industry. The idea is simple: what if everything humans ate and/or consumed came in packaging that could be composted? In this way, the products we produce under our own brand and 100% of the products we co-pack for other companies become testing platforms for compostable packaging, by design. Once functional films and laminate structures have been tested and verified, they are available to any other company that wishes to use them.    Farmer Compensation: Organic & Fair Trade Are Not Enough Since day #1, we have been engaged in sourcing and supply chain development based on the concept that organic and fair trade practices are not enough to assure food security for generations to come, and that despite 20+ years of practice and millions of dollars in organic and fair trade premiums being paid out, the majority of small cacao farmers worldwide are still living in poverty. Our model for sourcing cacao includes verification that farmgate prices — the price paid to the actual farmer — are a minimum of 30% higher than West African commodity marked based compensation, and that from a functional level, we are actually completely de-coupled from commodity market rates. This assures stability in compensation for farmers that they can depend on, at rates up to double or more of what fair trade guarantees. Additionally, unlike traditional fair trade certification programs, our model can be applied to small farmer groups and co-operatives that cannot shoulder traditional certification costs and annual renewals. This compensation model implicitly includes additional income for farmers based on quality of production, post-harvest practices, and fermentation, so there is always room for improvement and additional compensation over time.    Agroforestry & Regnenerative Agriculture: Economic Models to Sequester Carbon & Prevent Deforestation In 2017 we fully transitioned our sourcing of our two main raw ingredients — cacao and coconut — to exclusively come from regenerative and/or agroforestry based agriculture systems. With over 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions being generated from growing, manufacturing, and transporting food for human consumption, we are doing our part to reverse this trend by supporting economic models of agriculture that do the opposite, sequestering atmospheric carbon and mitigating the effects of climate change. On a local level, this means that we support farmer groups that do not clear cut or destroy natural forests for agriculture, and that instead we buy from farmers that promote biodiversity through the planting and care of multiple food, hardwood, and plant crops in addition to the cacao and coconut we purchase from them. Additionally, we are at the forefront of a nonprofit multi-stakeholder push to develop a compensation premium for cacao growers to implement regenerative agriculture principles, meaning farmer compensation increases as ecological stewardship principles are implemented on the farm level.","Agriculture","Artisan; Agricultural Products and Services; Community Development; Distribution and Retail; Food and Beverages; Manufacturing","","","","","","","We've received many awards for our chocolate, most notably for our single origin Eco Kakao bar.

At the same time, Sama Sama pays sanitation entrepeneurs for toilet installation immediately upon delivery, creating a working capital gap for Sama Sama. Since our customers typically do not qualify for traditional loans, Sama Sama manages the required financing internally. Together with the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab, we have developed an innovative psychometric credit assessment process to overcome traditional barriers to credit assessment for our customers who are mostly unbanked and unsalaried. Our repayment rates are impressive, with 90% of expected payments collected to date. In order to scale and generate further impact, Sama Sama requires a working capital loan for a revolving fund that would allow Sama Sama to cover its cost of sales and inventory needs, while collecting customer payments over time.  Specifically, the working capital will have the following uses: •	Covering Sama Sama’s cost of goods sold until revenue is received, including sourcing and stocking of toilet inputs such as squat pans and sitting toilets to strengthen the fragmented supply chain, enabling local sanitation entrepeneurs in northern Ghana access quality inputs at stable and affordable prices, as well as providing income for community-level sales agents selling toilets on commission for Sama Sama. •	Lowering barriers to entering the sanitation market by offering loans to sanitation entrepreneurs for start-up equipment such as cement block moulds and rings. •	Bridging the gap between low-income rural consumers and local sanitation entrepreneurs by allowing customers to pay for their toilet in affordable monthly increments, whilst facilitating sanitation entrepreneurs to get paid upfront by Sama Sama for toilets delivered. Inventory Financing; 30% of this loan will be used to acquire squat pans, sitting toilet and moulds. Working Capital: 70% of the loan will be used in financing rural toilet business entrepreneurs toilet deliveries and sales commissions.","This loan will allow us to install an estimated 1,000 toilets, enabling 13,000 people to have access to an improved toilet at home.  ","By ensuring effective collections of monthly installments from customers through our automated mobile money collection channel, and through revenues earned from the sale of inventory items to local toilet entreprenuers such as squat pans and sitting toilets.

This is still half the capacity of what only Carrefour can sell.  To fulfil the order, we hope to also work with contract farmers who will help meet the balance and also enable us to supply more hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, butcheries, other institutions and home deliveries.","We anticipate to make monthly payments of approximately 2,100 USD per month for 12 months to repay the 25,000 USD loan.   With our increased production capacity, we project to make sales more than 1,800Kgs per month at 6 USD per kg translating to revenues above 10,800 USD per month.   In addition, we will also be selling rabbit breeds to contract farmers at an average of USD 30 per breeding doe (female rabbit). We hope to support 100 contract farmers in the first year each with an average of 10 breeding does hence generating an income of USD30,000 in the first year.   Therefore, we can confidently and sustainably pay the monthly instalments without straining and also be able to scale up the farm more during the first year.","No","","","","","","","We were requested for a title deed with valuation above USD 50,000 for a loan with an interest rate of 14%"

The Fund is an independent non-profit entity, and it has been working extensively with at-risk populations, including people who inject drugs and commercial sex workers and men who has sex with men. These populations suffer from various social and economic impacts of living in areas of high HIV prevalence and are at increased risk of infection and discrimination. The goal of UNITUS is to provide access to healthcare, social services, and educational opportunities for vulnerable populations, and to decrease the spread of HIV.  By creating a network of support and care we can protect the health of at risk populations and decrease the prevalence of socially significant diseases in Mykolayiv and Mykolayiv region (Mykolayivska oblast).","During 18 years of our operations, UNITUS fund worked on over 40 projects valuing over 5,000,000USD. The fund’s experience spans to projects valued up to 800,000USD. These projects include working with girls from at-risk groups to prevent them being involved in the commercial sex industry. In addition, the fund worked with the local transgender population involved in the commercial sex industry. Specifically, we work with these groups (including the ones who use intravenous and psycho-trophic drugs) to maintain their reproductive health and encourage behavior change in order to prevent HIV, various STIs and hepatitis infections. We have been supported by Elena Pinchuk Anti-AIDS fund which creates, equips and supports mobile clinics used for treatment, prevention and monitoring of children who have AIDS in Ukraine regions to serve families affected by HIV infection in the city of Mykolayiv and the entire Mykolayivska oblast of Southern Ukraine.   Every year our case managers serve over 120 clients. Specifically, they observe and assist each client from 4 to 11 months. Every year, over 7,000 people throughout the oblast receive a variety of services to decrease infection by distributing condoms, needles, HIV- and hepatitis B and C-testing kits, consultations, referrals and social services.  Since 2013, we have been establishing programs for teenagers from at-risk groups in Mykolayiv and Nikoaev oblast to have an easier access to medical services, consulting and HIV- and hepatitis- testing. In addition, we provided services to over 2,000 at risk-teenagers and young women and transgender youth involved in commercial sex.    Unfortunately, the fund does not have a steady flow of financing due to the fact that the support of the current donors is under jeopardy. Therefore, currently the fund is trying to branch out of the HIV prevention field (although it is still our main focus) that include recycling, environmental problems, domestic violence and children's suicide. In order to thrive in the current depressing economy of Ukraine, we need a supplemental source of income. Therefore, we are looking to apply for a micro-loan to obtain a compact solar energy 20KW plant to finance our projects and continue helping our communities to tackle various socio-economic issues.","","Education; Health Services and Supplies; Services","","","","","","","","USD","165000","165000","Yes","Break-even","25000","36","6","Bureaucracy in Ukraine is a pretty lengthy process -- particularly, the issuance of permits for building and operating of the plant, which can take up to 2-3 months.  Construction process can take up to 1.5-2 months.  Tuning and smoothing over the operations can take up to 1.5 months. ","Once a month: USD 694.4 (within 36 months)","This loan will help UNITUS fund to be sustainable to continue its fight with HIV infection through green energy!","We are planning to purchase a compact solar energy plant to generate electricity off-the-grid.

Our mission is to create affordable access to drinking water through 10 franchised water production sites across Arusha, the third largest city in Tanzania (414,000 population within city boundaries and including peri-urban population estimated to be 1,000,000). We will do this by having a water purification manufacturing line, serving one community of 50,000 people with an associated network of 10 local micro-resellers within a 2 km radius. The primary purpose of our choice of products will be to ensure customers return for water refills (after having paid for a bottle deposit) through our network of resellers and local production units.

We are targeting the middle and bottom 70% of the under-served population who are within walking distance of a store (up to 3km radius), who typically drink boiled or untreated water as they cannot afford to regularly purchase safe water. With our pricing of 200 TShs ($0.09) per litre we can provide an affordable quality water drinking solution for people living under the $1.90 poverty line, as well as the mid and low income market.   Through providing packaged refillable safe drinking water, we, like Jibu in other countries, will reduce household costs and improve general community health through greatly reducing water-borne diseases, as well as the carbon emissions and respiratory illness caused by boiling water over wood and charcoal. We aim to reduce plastic waste as well by ensuring our plastic is safe and appropriate to be refilled. We are bringing the Jibu model to Tanzania, which has been hugely successful in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe with over 45 million litres of water distributed, 550 jobs created, and 195 social businesses launched.

Selling the packaged water and customers refilling their purchased bottles in our network will be generating sales revenue. The motorbike will allow us to do local deliveries to agents and resellers, pushing up volumes sold, and increasing revenue from more bottle sales and substitute the costs of hiring external motorbikes.  Without the loan, we would not maximise the opportunity of using the already leased machines to produce water and earn revenue from them, along with other additional costs of bottle inventory, team, and other costs as indicated above. With the right working capital, we are likely, even with conservative sales projections, to generate considerable sales revenue and create substantial impact.   Only after successfully operating the 3 water production & refill centres, we will open up franchising of the production units, firstly to the network of micro-franchises who have shown an ability to distribute water to our communities in an affordable manner and give them territories to manage. Our goal in the next year is to have another 7 Franchises setup in Arusha, bringing affordable safe drinking water to an addressable market of 500,000 customers. We expect a penetration rate of up to 7.5%, this will reach 37,500 customers with a daily average consumption of 1 litre / day.","After the grace period, on a monthly basis, we will pay back the loan from our incurred sales revenue from al our 3 stores.   Store 1 will start selling TBS-approved water from 15th March 2018 when our final TBS certificate arrives (we have TFDA certification already). In addition, when Stores 2 and 3 are operational after receiving the loan, the revenue generated from these two stores will further support payback of the loan. In total, after the grace period, 8-13% of combined store revenue will be used to repay this loan.   The first store already has all the staff hired, with a second team ready being trained as apprentices, for quick movement into the second and third stores as trained staff. Each production unit (store) will have 4 full-time staff (Store Manager, Sales Officer, Production Officer 1 & 2), supported by the Jibu country team including myself, the Operations Manager, Franchise Officer, Book-keeper and BDO. Based on other Jibu operating stores in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, all water production stores are selling enough water to generate significant revenue and service existing loans.  *For more details request financial projections.","No","","","","","","","We are a new company (< 1 year) and in Tanzania the criteria for a loan is 1 year of operations.

We will do this by having a water purification manufacturing line, serving one community of 50,000 people with an associated network of 10 local micro-resellers within a 2 km radius.

Through providing packaged refillable safe drinking water, we, like Jibu in other countries, will reduce household costs and improve general community health through greatly reducing water-borne diseases, as well as the carbon emissions and respiratory illness caused by boiling water over wood and charcoal. We aim to reduce plastic waste as well by ensuring our plastic is safe and appropriate to be refilled. We are bringing the Jibu model to Tanzania (under an exclusive Master Franchise Agreement), which has been hugely successful in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe with over 45 million litres of water distributed, 550 jobs created, and 195 social businesses launched.

Selling the packaged water and customers refilling their purchased bottles in our network will be generating sales revenue.   Without the loan, we would not maximise the opportunity of using the already leased machines to produce water and would have to incur a high cap-ex to purchase them, along with other additional costs of bottle inventory, team, and other costs as indicated above. With the right working capital, we are likely, even with conservative sales projections, generate considerable sales revenue. ","Every month, we will pay back the loan from our incurred sales. We will already have sales being done from Store 1, which will start selling TBS-approved water from 1st February 2018. This revenue will be used to pay back the loan. In addition, when Stores 2 and 3 are functional, the revenue generated from those will allow payback of the loan.

Once it has achieved this goal, by 2024, the company will expand its product lineup to include other vegetables and high-value, highly nutritious crops.

We believe that the best way to make small-scale farming more profitable is to provide farmers with access to the services that they need and want, when and where they want them.  To accomplish this, we have developed and tested a micro-franchise service business model that charges a flat fee per ton to dry rice, corn and beans at harvest time.  This fee is less than half of the valued added by drying. This means that small farmers growing paddy, corn and soybeans can make money simply by watching us dry their harvests for them and then selling them dry instead of wet at a significantly higher price.    An average small rice farmer can increase their earnings by up to 28% simply by using our service. The basis of this calculation is quite simple. Dry paddy is worth an average of $27/ton more than wet paddy at harvest time.  Most small farmers cannot dry their paddy in bulk, so they sell it wet. Our franchises charge $12 to dry a ton of paddy, so a farmer using one of our drying services makes an additional $15/ton over selling wet.  Instead of making a profit of $54/ton, they make $69/ton on average.  The same basic math holds true for other crops that require drying such as corn, soybeans and peanuts.  Each dryer franchise costs $10,000 to launch and will directly increase small farmers incomes by up to $22,380 per year ($373 each for 60 farming families).  We launched our first four dryer franchises in October.  We plan to launch 130 more in the next 24 months.","","Agricultural Products and Services; Manufacturing; Services","","","","","Winrock International","We are one of eight agritech startups from ASEAN that Winrock's Tech4Farmers program selected for its current cohort.  https://www.facebook.com/tech4farmersasia/?ref=br_rs","We won the top award at the Tech4Farmers 2.0 competition in Thailand in September.  We have been shortlisted on a GBP 400,000 grant from the DaNa Facility.","USD","$110,000","$42,000","No","Revenue generating","50000","12","6","We will launch the franchises during the harvest season so the franchisees can learn how to use the equipment and the local farmers can see the benefit, but they will not have very many customers during that initial season.

We want to be prudent in our estimates.","December 2017 – disbursement  June 2018 – November 2018 (each month) $8,334 per month for six months","","Achamar is a commercial entity. Currently, we purchase shells and services from OPRE, the cooperative representing the El Manglito community that NOS has helped restore. The shells come from a bay that OPRE and NOS have helped restore; the bay had no shellfish 5 years ago, and over 4 million shells now, with the number expected to grow to 20 million by 2022, with proper stewardship.   Achamar estimates its overall funding needs by looking at expected revenues, expenses, receivables, inventories, and payables, as well as by looking at investments it will make (loans to OPRE as well as fixed asset purchases). To be specific, in the first 2 months of operation (September and October), Achamar recorded revenue of 33,353 US dollars, but had negative operating cash flow of ($34,393), building up frozen product inventories of $33,428, making advance payments to OPRE of $35,588, and providing a loan to OPRE of $12,162. We pay OPRE immediately, but must wait several weeks to ship the frozen product, and several more weeks to receive payment for the product.  Without a track record, the only funding Achamar is  able to mobilize is short-term working capital debt, from impact-oriented institutions like Kiva and foundations that offer loans at sub-market rates.   We will not ‘allocate’ the Kiva loan, in the way that nonprofits allocate restricted donations. Put another way, the Kiva loan supports Achamar’s approach (and working capital needs) as a whole, not a particular investment or expense.","A business only motivated by profit would pay the harvesting cooperative at a much lower rate, and with significant delay. Instead Achamar pays the community cooperative each week, as soon as the harvest is counted for the week, and at 35-50% above market rates.   The community is desperate for sources of income, and would otherwise turn to illegal fishing in the Gulf of California. Achamar considers this an ‘investment’ in the community, as the shellfish population grows to a more commercial as well as environmentally sustainable level.   The Kiva loan (and another working capital loan from the PRI arm of the ICF foundation) help us continue this temporary arrangement with the cooperative.  The Kiva and ICF loans allow us to build a commercial track record, while still supporting the community. Without a commercial track record, we cannot attract long-term financing that will give Achamar a secure, long term financial base.","We will pay back the loan from additional financing we will receive in the first quarter of 2018. At that time, grant funding of $140,000 is expected from the Mexican government, in addition to an 8-year loan for $300,000, and a Preferred Equity placement for an additional $300,000.    We want our commercial revenue streams for the next 2-3 years to principally finance the community, and only subsequently to repay our long term loans and dividends, once our revenues and profits are sufficiently high.  (The planned long term loan and equity amounts are high because NOS and Achamar will start work in two new communities in 2018, replicating what we have already done in the El Manglito community of La Paz and in the adjoining Bay).","Yes","250000","7%","ICF (through its PRI program)","50000","20%","various commercial banks",""

We anticipate above industry average default rates during the testing period of this new product, and we want to ensure we are able to repay the loan in time. The grace period also accounts for the fact that our clients will repay the loan over a 4-12 months period.","Assuming we will receive the loan in Dec. we would repay the loan in 6 monthly instalments between July and December 2018. However, we anticipate the possibility to prepay the loan, which will lead to a shorter loan duration.","","Current microfinance products are not an appropriate match for property formalization financing, considering that the service has unique characteristics compared to the types of purchases and services traditionally offered in the microfinance space (eg working capital, capex, etc). Our objective with the Kiva loan is to pilot an innovative new financing product that is designed specifically for property formalization. Considering that this type of financing has not been offered before, we will need to apply our lessons learned and iterate the product frequently throughout the process. We will research and test the following loan structures for the pilot:  (1) We manage the whole process directly, which would imply setting up internal systems and hiring dedicated loan officer. Given the operational challenges and costs involved with monthly repayments, in this scenario we would offer 4 quarterly instalments of 25%, 35%, 25% and 15% of financed value (net of the deposit we will receive). These percentages are based on the average division of costs across our main property formalization service life-cycles. However, we will develop a tailor-made plan for each of the 30+ formalization services we offer, considering that each has production phases with different time periods and costs. Generally, our objective is to avoid assuming service costs before receiving the corresponding repayments with each service phase.  (2) Outsource collections to a credit agency. This would lower the operational burden on us, but we need to study the costs and the trade offs with Scenario 1. If commissions are reasonable and we decide to pursue this option, we could offer monthly repayment plans to clients. Under this scenario we would divide the quarterly payments from Scenario 1 into 3 equal monthly instalments for a total of 12 instalments.   Another option we will explore is to offer mixed quarterly/ monthly repayment plans depending on the service cycle and customer characteristics. In all cases, we expect to require a modest deposit to weed out uncommitted customers and ensure we have a cushion for missing payments, in case the client doesn’t fulfil her payment obligation.   We plan to apply a markup to our service price in the order of 15-20% to account for inflation, foreign exchange risk, and default risk, and offer the customer an installment plan that charges a premium for customers who select a longer-term plan with more payments. With average microfinance interest rate between 25 and 43%, and our field experience with lending partners confirming an average monthly rate of 2.5% (34.5% annual), our markup will offer substantially better conditions to clients, while increasing our financial inclusion impact.","Considering that traditional microfinance loans were not designed with property formalization services in mind, our customers face a number of barriers in financing their property formalization service, including long processing times, payment plans and time periods that do not match the service cycle and value creation, and excessive requirements. Moreover, existing microfinance loans do not take the customer’s likelihood of formalization and the associated anticipation of collateral creation in their analysis. Considering that our core business is to collect, analyze and process property data for formalization, we are uniquely positioned to pilot out the first microfinance loan designed exclusively for property formalization.   In 2017, $410k USD in potential revenue did not materialize because our customers were unable to access appropriate financing for their property formalization service. This pilot will not only allow us to test the relationships between property data and creditworthiness, but it will also enable to capture additional revenue that has been locked up in the financing bottleneck.","","No","","","","","","","We have not applied for a loan (secured or unsecured) in the past, so we do not know exactly what the terms would be."

The loan will be used to generate a positive impact for coffee farmers in one of the most impoverished regions in Nicaragua. Given our four-year experience in this business, we have directly dealt with the risk associated with beekeeping, including hive and honey theft as well as damage. Therefore, instead of owning thousands of hives across the country our growth model is rooted in a win-win partnership with smallholder farmers in Nicaragua. Smallholder farmers are the backbone of the country’s economy, yet are the losers along the value chain. Coffee farmers, especially, find themselves in a precarious situation. They are hindered by exploitative markets, lack of access to credit, impacts of erratic weather patterns, and high levels of economic vulnerability to unexpected events. Moreover, coffee farmers are located in pristine protected areas that benefit from constant rich in nectar and pollen sources. Entering the beekeeping business for these coffee farmers would be highly profitable considering they don't need to invest in any additional land and only need to dedicate around 1 hour/day to their beekeeping activities. Studies show that beekeeping in these areas result in high honey yields (40kg/hive) as well as a 20% increase in crop yields. AESA will provide coffee smallholder farmers with a “sweet support bundle” which includes, 3 hives, 4-month long technical training course in Bee Biology, Integrated Pest Management and Hive Management, as well as equipment. AESA will then purchase honey from the coffee farmers and donate the organic certification to those that demonstrate interest and capacity to become “promoters,” experts who will serve other beekeepers in the community. The USD$3000 for marketing will help create more brand awareness for our local organic packaged honey, JICOTE. By creating new entrants in the honey value chain, AESA would improve the livelihoods of hundreds of smallholder farmers, and contribute to keeping this world green.","Through this loan, AESA will increase its annual revenue by 2x. Having established a network of loyal beekeepers in high yielding areas AESA will have enough honey to, first, place JICOTE in Supermercados La Colonia, the largest supermarket chain the Nicaragua, which would increase our brand’s market share form 5% to 30% in the next 2 years. JICOTE is the only certified organic honey brand in Nicaragua, making it a gourmet product that sells for 10%  above other brands. Secondly, our network of high yielding beekeepers will allow AESA to export in bulk directly to honey importers in Europe and the Middle East.","","No","","","","","","","Principal: USD $50,000.00 Interest: 18% Term: 1 year"

A longer grace period is better for myAgro because farmers will have paid more towards the cost of their precision planters later in the season, which gives myAgro more capacity to repay the loan.","Quarterly. Ideally we would repay the loan in two tranches - one in July 2018 and one in September 2018. ","","In addition to growing the number of farmers we serve, myAgro’s key strategic objective is tripling the amount of income each farmer generates.  The fastest way to do this in Mali and Senegal is to help farmers increase the amount of land that they can actually cultivate, which is currently limited to about 20% of the land they own due to a lack of sufficient labor during the short planting season.  To solve this problem, myAgro has created a precision planter that allows a farmer to plant 3x as much land during the short planting season.  We have been trialing the precision planter in the field for the last four years and are now ready to scale its distribution with an objective of deploying 1,500 in the coming season through a combination of sales to farmers and a service model.    myAgro needs a total of $350,000 in working capital loans to finance the up-front cost of manufacturing the 1,500 precision planters. A $50,000 loan from Kiva lenders would make up part of that total cost and would be paid to our manufacturer.","myAgro sells the precision planters to farmers for $310, which includes a small margin for myAgro. In addition to the revenue from direct sales, selling precision planters to farmers also has the potential for a multiplier effect on myAgro’s sales of seeds and fertilizer. If a farmer has the capacity to plant more land with a precision planter, then his/her need for seeds and fertilizer is increased as well.","","Yes","500000","3","Ceniarth","","","",""

We also often offer grace periods of up to 3 months to our clients when they pay in installments, so we want the cash flows to match. However, we are flexible if the grace period for this loan is less than 6 months.","We are flexible but suggest a quarterly repayment schedule: it minimizes the costs of wire transfers and gives us time to collect and account for all the payments.","","Our loan would be used to purchase solar components for the installations that we do. We have a huge pipeline of installations for businesses and institutions in rural areas, almost all of whom request to pay in installments of between 6-18 months. Because our suppliers do not offer terms, at the moment we struggle to allow this, and thus very few installations end up happening. This loan would give us the the working capital to be able to allow our customers to pay in installments, thus unlocking the market.  Since every installation is custom designed according to the client’s needs and budget, and because having components sit in storage can lead to deterioration, we will not be making an upfront purchase. Instead, we will put it into its own account and use it for paying for cost of goods at the time of sale. The fund will be used for: panels, charge controllers, batteries, inverters, wiring, bulbs, remote monitoring devices (if applicable), and DC appliances (such as TVs).  For this fund we would focus on community institutions like schools, health centres, schools, NGOs, and  savings cooperatives.  The average ticket size of each installation is about $3,000, and typically clients usually put a deposit of at least 30% and payback over 12 months. A $25,000 loan with 6 month grace period and 4 quarterly payback installments would allow us to do up to 25 installations in a 18 month period. If 15 of these are schools with an average student body of 300 students, that means over 4,500 students could benefit.","We have a pipeline of quotes totalling over $300,000, most of which are being held back by lack of funds on the clients’ side. Local currency loans from a bank, even if available, can be 25-30%, making it unaffordable.  Almost all the installations we’ve done in the last year have been through offering payment in installments, and thanks to our strong due diligence and high level of after-sales servicing, have 100% payback rate. This loan will allow us to extend these terms to all eligible clients, and thus drastically increase the number of deals we do each month. A zero-interest loan allows us to offer financing at a much better rate than the 8-9% we’d have to tack on if we were to financing this with a USD loans at market rates, thus providing even added boost to affordability and attractiveness to clients.","","Yes","40000","8%","Angel investors","","","",""

This is part of our payment structure with clients to receive payment on the coffee upon the clients' receipt of the product, which happens throughout the year. Secondly, as many clients order throughout the year, not all at once (or upon Fabretto receiving the loan amount), costs of roasting/packaging/shipping occur on a monthly  basis, and therefore revenue is generated on that same frequency. Six months gives us enough time to accumulate revenue from clients so we can start to repay Kiva in appropriate and consistent amounts.","The loan will be repaid in 8 months, in 8 equal monthly payments.

In this case for $12,500 for contracts, we would pay $6,250 in Nov. 2017, and $6,250 in May 2018. As we would receive the coffee in Q1 2018/ beginning January 2018, that is when we can start selling it and therefore incurring processing costs (roasting, packaging, labeling, shipping). Based on our monthly sales, this would mean a monthly cost of $2,833.36 (416.67 pounds *6.8 cost= 2833.36) from Jan-Dec 2018 (for a total of $34,000 per year (12*2833.36=34,000).","As pre-harvest financing, this loan will help us buy contracts on our core product, coffee.

The pilot findings have proved our thesis to develop a credible DESCO in Kenya and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.   The Kiva loan will enable us to expand in Kenya and open new a new market in the Katanga Province of The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in late 2017.  The loan will specifically be used to: 1) assist with adding personnel for our Kenya operations (est. $7.5k); 2) assist with purchasing a portion of additional inventory for Kenya (est. $30k; 3) assist with legal incorporation costs of the new Sunspot DRC entity (est. $7.5k); and, 4) assist with the cost of new personnel in DRC (est. $5k).","The founders are seasoned ex-telecom executives with deep experience building high-growth telecoms in sub-Saharan Africa and other emerging nations. After a year of researching the PayG SHS market in 2015, the founders formed Mauritius-based SEI and its wholly-owned Kenyan subsidiary, Sunspot Energy Kenya Limited in 2016 with $320,000 of personal equity capital.  Our overarching objective is to develop SEI, Sunspot Energy Kenya and Sunspot Energy DRC into profitable and fiscally prudent DESCOs. Kiva’s support will complement the ongoing efforts that are underway to capitalize SEI with additional equity to realize that vision.  The loan will further our expansion in Kenya now that the market pilot is close to its conclusion and that business risks are well understood and can be effectively mitigated. The loan will also fund a portion of the groundwork for operations in DRC, where there is a huge opportunity to introduce Spark Possibilities products using a PayG platform. We estimate that the financial prospects in DRC will significantly outweigh the financial potential in Kenya.","","No","","","","","","","We have not been quoted a secured loan without personal guarantees and/or other support from the founders given that SEI is not profitable, despite the fact that we are close to EBITDA breakeven (exempting any payments to the founders)."

The first is that our manufacturer requires 50% up-front payment 60 days prior to the delivery of any units. This means that our batch of 750 units will be delivered between November and February of 2018, but we must pay 50% up front in September for this to happen. This ties up our cash significantly.  The second reason is that because of the industry we are in, and because of the partners that we work with, we have a long sales cycle. This means we pay for inventory up front, but our customers take a long time to pay us. In developed countries, our customers generally get pre-authorisation from insurance companies before ordering a unit for their patient. In developing countries, our partners are reliant on fundraising, so often it takes time for them to be able to pay us for the units they need. With a long sales cycle, our inventory sits on our books for a longer period of time, and our cash is tied up.","Every quarter, we will report the number of units we have sold and received payment for during the previous quarter, and repay the full manufacturing cost per unit. If at the end of the maturity term there is still outstanding principal we will repay a balloon repayment for the remainder owed.","","We need working capital to fund our inventory of our product (a high-performing but affordable prosthetic knee for amputees). In the last 18 months we have fit 800 patients and our monthly volume is growing. We have an excellent manufacturer in Germany and we want to do another manufacturing run of 1,500 units. This will cost us over 250k USD. Because we cannot afford this amount up front, we have asked our manufacturer to split the run into two batches. In order to purchase the necessary components, our manufacturer requires up-front payment of 50%. (The rest is paid upon successful delivery of small 150 unit batches over a few months). This loan will help us to pay the up-front cost for the first batch, which will cost approximately $60k USD.","This loan will help us to generate revenue because it is helping us to pay for our inventory, which we then sell to customers and partners who are fitting amputees with full prosthetic legs. It is through the sale of these units that we generate revenue.  More info on our social business model - Our aim is to revolutionise the provision of high quality prosthetics to all amputees, no matter where they live and no matter what their ability to pay. We do this by designing high quality prosthetic devices that truly rehabilitate an amputee but can be manufactured affordably. We then sell our products using a tiered pricing structure, designed to ensure as many patients as possible get access to our products. In countries with healthcare infrastructure, we make sure our products are covered by insurance schemes. In developing countries with no insurance coverage in place, we sell to humanitarian providers fitting low-income patients for free at a price that fits within their budgets. Overall, our blended profit margin will allow us to achieve financial sustainability at scale. ","","No","","","","","","","In general, most lenders require at least $1M in annual revenues.

Thus 100% of this Loan will go toward bridging the gap in making sure that we can order 1000 units of this system on a quarterly basis. Currently we have invested the sum of USD22,505.00 into 500units of this Product The loan will be utilised as follow: we intend to budget the sum of USD45,010.00 and  US4,390.00 for ocean freight.  Another $600 will be set aside for insurance of the goods while in transit. This bring  the total cost outlay for 1000 units of Cloud Energy multifunction Solar home system CIF to USD50,000.00 We will use own funds to clear the goods from customs , marketing and Sales activities. How exactly will this loan help you generate revenue? The Loan will help us generate revenue the two board ways. 3.	The zero interest rate of the loan ensures that our beneficiaries get our Cloud Energy multi-function Solar home system at very affordable cost. The product is new to our line of larger solar solutions and electronics; the initial 500 units will confirm the demand and this working capital can help us scale this product more quickly.    4.	As this loan will bridge working capital, it ensures that we have more funding to continue with deployment of the Cloud Energy multi-function Solar home system and this will have a very positive impact on the population. As we can now do more volume of products on a monthly basis. 5.	Much of the company revenue comes from the sale of larger solar solutions and electronics such as charge controllers,  inverters, and solar Fridge and freezers The additional working capital ensures the other lines of our business do not suffer so we will be able to repay this loan promptly regardless of any delays related to the roll out of this new product.","","No","","","","","","","Presentation of Bank statement, Annual Audited Report, 25% yearly Interest rate with 2 Percent Management Fees on the loan and provision of additional Collateral to secure the loan."

The business started off distributing & marketing its own instant noodle brand (eeZee Noodles) before branching into manufacturing nutritional products in 2015.  Background:	 Malnutrition is one of the leading challenges facing Southern Africa. In Zambia, currently one in every two children is stunted. The effects of increased urbanisation has increased the cases of malnutrition in urban areas due to non availability of nutritious foods. Many of the urban retail centres are being stocked with foreign foods products (too expensive for the Zambian bottom of pyramid consumer) and are not fortified with valuable micronutrients. Because of these frightening statistics, nutrition has become a public policy priority.  Accordingly, Java Foods developed eeZee Supa Cereal, a fortified high energy protein cereal made from locally grown corn & soya. The formulation was developed in partnership with Technoserve/USAID and has been duly certified by Zambia Bureau of Standards. Java Foods has already began product development using other locally acquired cereals for instance moringa & boabob and sorghum soya blend. Currently, Java Foods purchases a good volume of soyabean from rural farmers around Lusaka (approx. 260 farmers) and processes it into flour.  It is Java Foods intention to increase sourcing raw material direct from small scale farmers become an exclusive offtaker once sales volumes increase. Such direct outsourcing will help raise incomes of farmers (by giving them fair value for product) as well as reducing the cost of ingredients through the creation of an efficient supply chain. With respect to distribution, Java Foods sells it products mainly through urban retail centres and to insitutional customers like schools (under school feeding programmes) & hospitals. In 2016 Java Foods entered into an agreement with Care International & Living Goods to support the distribution of eeZee Supa Cereal into the rural areas using a roaming agents programme. This partnership has helped bring nutritious food products to the rural.","","","Agricultural Products and Services; Food and Beverages; Manufacturing","","","","","Scaling Up Nutrition Business Network; Living Goods Programme (Care International)","In 2010, the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement was launched to support national leadership and collective action to scale up nutrition. The SUN Business Network (SBN) is one of the four global networks that support SUN countries (along with UN, Civil Society and Donor Networks). It is convened by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and further supported by an Advisory Group comprised of business leaders. The SBN aims to reduce malnutrition in all its forms through mobilising business to invest and innovate in responsible and sustainable actions and operations. To do this SBN provides a neutral platform to broker partnerships and collaboration between business and all actors on nutrition at national, regional and global level to support SUN Country plans.  SBN’s three main objectives are:  1.	Mobilising business to contribute to reduce malnutrition in all forms 2.	Making nutrition more aspirational, accessible, affordable and available to the consumer 3.	Building the case for greater business engagement in nutrition amongst all stakeholders It is the only dedicated global platform for business and nutrition, with more than 300 members, including both multinational and national companies committing to improved nutrition throughout the world. Java Foods is one of the pioneer members of SBN from Zambia. Being part of this network enables Java Foods to access better technologies & innovations to produce high quality nutritious foods.   Java Foods CEO Monica Musonda  was invited to sit on the Global SBN Advisory Group as a representative from Africa in 2016. She is also a member of the UN Lead Group on Nutrition.","Java Foods was founded by Monica Musonda. Under her leadership, Java Foods has continued to engage with farmers and other players in the agricultural value chain in Zambia to creative an efficient and even playing field. Her efforts were recognised earlier this year when she was awarded the 2017 African Agribusiness Entrepreneur of the Year which recognizes entrepreneurs who have demonstrated outstanding achievements in agricultural input and value-added industries serving food and fiber production in Africa.

Despite it being a high quality and affordable product, sales of the product were very slow. A market survey conducted in November 2016 revealed that (i) consumers were unaware of the nutritional value/benefits of eeZee Supa Cereal and so were unwilling to spend on the product (ii) that more targeted marketing (clear & simple messaging) to mothers and children was required in order to make nutrition every day  (iii) eeZee Supa Cereal needed to change its packaging from polythene (plastic bag) to paper carton (cereals in cartons were perceived to be higher quality and also consumers felt that once opened it was easier to maintain freshness in a carton).   Java Foods is looking to borrow $40,600 (forty thousand six hundred dollars only) to fund the following: (a)	Capex: To fund purchase of a packaging machine ($12,600); (b)	Working Capital for the following: a.

We breed Black Soldier Fly (BSF) and use the larva to feed fishes - fresh or dried. The importation of fishmeal is no longer sustainable for most feed producers and fish feeds cost is increasing annually resulting in a persistent demand for over #120billion naira worth of fishmeal to sustain the aquaculture and livestock sector of Nigeria.  Kiva Loan is budgetted specifically as follows:  (1) $10,000 for production of Bold Nutrition BSF Cages.  (2) $40,000 to cover working capital for production and processing of BSF Protein Meal for onward sales to local feed producers.","As an Ashoka Fellow, my vision has always been to help communities consume more nutritious food while helping farmers increase their livelihoods. My life work has focused on reducing the cost of feeds for farmers through exploring the nutritional potentials of alternative ingredients. The economic shortfall of 2016 affected many Nigerian Fish farmers and feed manufacturers, forcing all key stakeholders to the national table to innovate a new solution to the coming fishmeal price and availability crisis.   Working with USAID Nigeria/MARKETS II project, BIF II Aquaculture and PIND Foundation I realized that one of the greatest need in the aquaculture sector is the demand for locally produced, affordable protein alternative to fishmeal. I also saw a lucrative business opportunity that also afforded me the chance to create jobs, fulfill my life vision or Ashoka mission and do something good for the environment. Within 2 months of launching Bold Nutrition we became the trailblazer and champion as we began using Black Soldier Fly to upcycle food waste and produce BSF larva - fresh and became the leaders of the alternative fishmeal movement in Nigeria. As a result BIF II, MARKET II and PIND Foundation are excited about collaborating with us to help thousands of their farmers across Nigeria. I am hoping that Kiva Funding will play a timely and instrumental role in helping us finance our short term goals and business targets to sell BSF larva, meal and cage technology to farmers and youths across Nigeria.   Kiva Loan will be used specifically to:  (1) finance production of BSF Cages for distribution and sale to aquaculture farmers and youths across Nigeria - people who want to breed BSF larva to feed their fish but do not want to spend large capital to set up a building structure. We are working with selected partners who are willing to purchase and adopt our cage technology.  (2) finance production of BSF larva and BSF meal (fishmeal alternative) for onward sales to local feed producers.","","Yes","50000","25%+","Deposit Money Banks","15750000","25%+","Deposit Money Banks",""

A loan is also valuable because we can deploy funds for various activities, and so avoid the oft-restricted nature of grant funding. The loan provides us with financial runway, and optimisation between our other funding streams, including product revenue streams, other loans, grants and donations.   We will use this loan for two key purposes: Open working capital - $25,000 to support two new team members in Australia who are in early stage of growth with Pollinate and setting up longer term revenue streams. Soft development capital - $25,000 to support growth on the ground in two key cities, Hyderabad and Kolkata. This will allow the cities to invest in hiring their Pollinator team, training local staff, buying stock etc, to enable them to get to their goal of financial sustainability faster.","The Australian team members funded by the loan are in a fundraising position. Currently, the Australian team generates $3 for every $1 spent across the entire organisation’s costs. In this way, by building up our team members they will be able to secure greater funding. The most obvious stream is our fellowship program. We have secured government contracts that will not kick in until January 2018. This funding allows us to keep growing the team over that period rather than waiting for the new funding to arrive. Our key cities, Hyderabad and Kolkata, need to increase their numbers of Pollinators and monthly sales to reach financial sustainability. This funding would be allocated to new stock and new Pollinators to increase the revenue in those cities. Importantly, the loan contributes to Pollinate becoming sustainable: efficient expansion in HYD and KOL would provide a template that could be replicated across India; with scale we can become financially self-sufficient.   *The question wasn’t asked, but we already hold loans with two private funders in Australia. We would welcome a conversation with Kiva on broader plans for loans with this in mind.","","Yes","50000","5%","","100000","5%","Private",""

They are user-friendly and clean, smokeless. The coconut waste briquettes serve the community with a source of clean energy and reduce deforestation. Kencoco also offer’s waste management solutions by collecting and using waste coconut shells and husks as raw materials.

A 4 kg tin used by the charcoal vendors holds about 2 kilos of charcoal. This averagely retails at 100 shillings. Kencoco Briquettes are priced at Ksh 30 ($0.3) per kg to bulk and wholesale customers who in turn resell to the consumers at Ksh 40 ($0.4) per Kg, which is very competitive bearing in mind the better quality, handling and efficiency.","","","Clean Energy and Power; Distribution and Retail; Manufacturing","","","","","Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves; Micro Enterprise Support Trust (MESPT)","MESPT The overall objective of the Micro-Enterprises Support Programme Trust (MESPT) is to promote economic growth, employment creation and poverty alleviation through ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT.

This is comprised of purchasing/delivery China side (2 mth), consolidation/shipping to PNG (2 mth), assembly PNG (1 mth), selling (3 mth) and contingency (2 mth).","During the past 18 months all revenues have been invested in R&D and building the market for our solar agro-processing machines in Papua New Guinea and other Pacific countries. We now have very strong sales pipeline ahead, which builds on the 75 systems we already have in field. We are set to essentially destroy diesel powered rice milling in Papua New Guinea this year.  To realise better return and help us achieve greater impact, PSS needs to improve the scale of our supply side to realise relative savings on procurement, shipping, wharfage/handling costs.  A $50,000 loan will enable us to double our next order volume from 100 machines and compatible solar systems, to 200, which will fill a container. With a greater order volume, we can expect 10-20% improved bulk order prices from our suppliers. Doubling our order volume will reduce  our fixed shipping and landing costs per unit by 50%. The net result is we can expect the landed cost of one system to be reduced by $185. For an order volume of 200 (made possible with $50,000 loan), this equates to an outright saving of $35,000. The remaining $15,000 of loan will be paid out of  profit on COGs of 200 systems, which is $100,000.","","No","","","","","","","Without tangible assets such as land (we rent), it is entirely unfeasible for us to qualify for a commercial loan."

","","The proposed loan would function as a bridge loan until revenue from our Global Leadership Program comes due. It is further backed up by Foundation funding under an existing conditional commitment. The budget for this loan is as Follows:  Staff Salaries(2 US, 7 in Ghana): $39,200 Global Leadership Program Recruitment: $4,000 Transportation to Villages Monitor Saha Water Businesses: $5,700 Water Quality Testing: $1,100","Although Saha is a non-profit, we establish for-profit social enterprises in Ghana. We work in the northern region of Ghana where our goal is simple: get poor people to drink clean water. We partner with entrepreneurial women in the village and set them up with a chlorinating business that provides clean water that all can afford. For $13 per person we provide simple water treatment technology to a village, mentor the women entrepreneurs and monitor the business for ten years. Saha provides every family a 20-liter plastic bucket with a lid and a tap to prevent re-contamination. Saha has opened 100 water businesses in rural Ghana. Every one of them is still running.   Financing rural water projects has been a major challenge in our sector. For-profit, social enterprise approaches have praise for sustainability, but these unsubsidized models do not reach the very poor, who need clean water the most. Free distribution is not successful in the long run.    Saha donates tanks and 20-liter buckets to each village, but does not provide any ongoing financial support. This subsidized water business model allows our entrepreneurs to charge prices that all can afford while still earning enough to cover long-term maintenance costs and pay themselves for their time. All of the revenue generated at each water businesses stays in the community and is managed by the water entrepreneurs. They do not pay Saha back for the initial donation. This has led to our un-paralleled, 100% businesses success rate and 75% adoption rate (75% of people in the villages where Saha works frequently purchase water from a Saha water business).   While the water sales revenue does not go back to Saha, we do have earned revenue from our Global Leadership Program (GLP). The GLP is a 3-week volunteer program that Saha hosts twice a year in in Ghana. The volunteers are paired in teams of four and work with Saha to help train new water entrepreneurs. Once the volunteers leave Ghana, the entrepreneurs’ water businesses are up and running. Saha will then provide long-term training and non-financial support to each business for ten years. The volunteers pay a $3,500 program fee. $1,500 of that fee is spent hosting each volunteer, and $2,000 is used to help cover the cost of the long-term support that Saha provides to our water entrepreneurs.  As mentioned above, the proposed loan would function as a bridge loan until revenue from our Global Leadership Program comes due. As shown in the budget, this loan will help to fund general operating expenses, including recruiting volunteers for our Global Leadership Program. We project to host 43 volunteers in January 2018, which would generate $150,5000 in earned revenue. Based on data from the previous 6 years of hosting this program, we project that 4% of that revenue will be generated in September, 12% in October, 25% in November, and the remaining 59% will be generated in December, when the final program payment is due.   In addition to the Global Leadership Program, this loan will be backed by committed Foundation fudning. As stated above, I am a 2016 Rainer Arnhold Fellow with the Mulago Foundation. As a part of this Fellows program, Saha receives a $50,000 catalyst grant each year for two years. Our second grant will be received in September 2017, follow the completion of the Mulago Fellows course.","edit: See Confluence","No","","","","","","",""

We qualify for 14.5% interest in local currency on secured loans, however it is difficult to meet security requirements.  Despite our high asset base, local banks have been hesitant to accept the security we can offer, since our assets consist mostly of inventory, machinery, materials in transit and receivables (with a 99%+ repayment rate).  Banks prefer security with titles - such as vehicles and land - a small proportion of our assets which we have already fully leveraged.  As a result, our total bank lending is the equivalent of only USD 42,000."

We will provide these products on credit (at manufacturer suggested retail prices) to women in Taita-Taveta County, a rural area approximately four hours north of Mombassa. Borrowers will receive a two-month grace period, and then repay their loans between six and twelve months.   The women we will lend to are members of established women’s groups who have registered with the government and elected a chairlady, treasurer, and secretary. Our Kenyan-based team will conduct a loan orientation workshop, collect loan applications, distribute the products, and collect repayments. For new applicants, Zawadisha works with the chairladies to assess the creditworthiness of the members (essentially assessing their levels of social capital). For established borrowers, we review their previous loan payments they have made to Zawadisha to determine if they can qualify for another loan. (If they have missed three or more payments they are not qualified for another loan, and previous loans must be repaid in full before they can access another product on credit.)  We currently have a waiting list of approximately 750 women in the Sagala region of Taita-Taveta County who are requesting 1,000 liter water tanks. The cost of goods is approximately $70 USD per tank, totaling $52,500. The retail price of each tank is $100 USD, and every loan will be assessed a 10% flat fee. Each water tank loan will generate $30 USD in profit and $10 USD in fees. Total gross revenue will be $82,500 USD. After accounting for cost of goods sold, Zawadisha will net $30,000 USD.  Zawadisha borrowers will repay approximately $9 USD per month over 12 months, totaling $6,750 USD total in monthly repayments. The loans will be fully repaid after 14 months (12 month terms, beginning after the two month grace period).   With our existing cash on hand and a $50,000 loan from Kiva, we can eliminate this wait list. Our business model will allow us to fulfill monthly Kiva loan repayments based on revenue generated from our lending program. Revenue generated from our existing loan portfolio in this region (approximately $7,000 USD per month) will cover our operating costs.   If we are not eligible to receive the full $50,000, a smaller amount will still allow us to fulfill a portion of these loans without compromising our ability to repay the Kiva loan.  Zawadisha’s main office is based in Taita-Taveta County in Maungu, and we have a team of local staff who have managed our operations for the past two years. We are currently serving approximately 1,500 women with $52,000 USD of loan payments from our current loan portfolio expected to be repaid in 2017. We have maintained a minimum 95% repayment rate since we started working in this region in late 2014. We are solving the “last mile” distribution and financing challenges that make the procurement of products such as solar lamps, clean cook stoves, and rain water tanks nearly impossible for the people who need them the most.","This loan will allow us to grow our operations by providing the capital necessary to purchase renewable energy and water products. Our ability to generate revenue is directly tied to the number of product loans we administer. We maintain an average 40% margin on each loan, which allows us to funnel the principal repayments into our debt repayment, and the profit is invested back into the organization to pay for general operations. Growing our loan portfolio in 2017 is one of the organization’s strategic goals, and our financial projections demonstrate that by 2018, we can become profitable (and not require grants or donations) if we grow our portfolio to 5,250 loans. In 2015, we provided approximately 750 loans; in 2016 1,450 loans; and in 2017 we are projecting 3,500 loans based on current customers and existing loan requests.

We have 100% repayment participation rate, with 8% of payments behind schedule.  This program was especially crucial in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew this fall when our suppliers faced mass loss of inventory and property damage. Loans allowed them to get their businesses back up running to business as usual in weeks rather than months.  The Kiva loan of $10,000 will allow us to 10x our current program, making  $1,666 available in loans each month to our suppliers. Currently, suppliers complete an application for loans which are reviewed by Thread staff. Loan recipients are given a grace period of 3 months, then make 20% repayments for 5 months until the loan is paid back.  I have a table that shows the structure for how we will make these loans, receive repayments from our suppliers, and then pay back Kiva. It won't let me paste the table into this application format, but I'd be happy to send it along to your team via email or other format.","This micro loan program helps Thread to secure our supply chain at the levels facing the most risk. As we continue to scale our operations, and begin producing fabric at volume for some of the biggest apparel brands in the world, having a regular supply of plastic is crucial to our operations. These micro loans ensure that our suppliers don't have to shut down their businesses due to equipment failures or cash flow problems.   Making these businesses more sustainable benefit these entrepreneurs in Haiti, as well as the collectors that rely on selling them plastic for income.  By increasing our loan program, we will be able to make more loans to deserving Haitian and Honduran entrepreneurs as we scale the program into Honduras in 2017. We are also interested in bringing the opportunity of a slightly larger loan ($2k, for example) to selected high performing suppliers for investment in new equipment such as a baler, which would take their operations to the next level and have major impact in their community. Access to this level of capital is extremely difficult for our supplier network.","edit: See Confluence","Yes","","","","","","",""

We also cultivated a good working relationship with our suppliers which allowed us credit inventory to work with.  This strategy helped us grow organically without having to rely on bank loans with unfavorable interest rates. As an SME, we also did not have any collateral making it impossible to access any substantial loan to expand our business.   As our business expanded, we moved from small scale artisanal work and began to attract orders from corporate clients to the extent that the bulk of our orders now constitute 70% from corporates and 30% from private home owners.   In transacting business with our corporate clients however, even though orders tend to be on a large scale, they usually will not pay substantial up-front payments and most often we are only give tender documents as a guarantee to be paid 30-60 days after delivery and installation. This means we are unable to make payments on account to our suppliers in time and this has affected our credit facilities with our suppliers.  We have realized that to enable us scale up, there is the desperate need to without compromising on our brand, become mechanized to allow volume production such that contractors are able to buy pre-fabricated pieces  without waiting in the production line and for the company not be under duress all the time because of cash flow problems.  The loan therefore will allow us to stock up raw material to produce within the year, take on more orders and to free up capital for other operational expenses.","There is a demand for housing and office blocks and there is no shortage of projects.   Our ambitious goal is to bid for large scale projects currently ongoing within the construction and manufacturing industry and compete favorable with imports currently on the market.

IPROSARUDE will give a 2% of credit. For example, the loan of 300 000 BIF will be repaid after 6 months with an interest of 2%, which equals to 336 000 so the interest of 36 000 FIB. Suppose that a credit of 300,000 FIB has been given to each 30 people, so an amount of 9,000,000 BFU after 6 months will generate an income of 1,600,000 FIB. For the next 12 firsts months we want to start with 26 cooperatives with which will give as income of 1,600,000 x8 = 12 000 000BIF so just 7 189 USD of incomes  b.	Another income will come from the 10% of guarantee which will be given for each credit. This money will be placed in a bank and will generate interests. Here for each cooperative with its 30 members will provide a guarantee fund of 10 / 100x300 000x8x30 = 7 200 000 just 4 313 USD BIF. This money will be placed in a bank and over 6 months will generate an interest of 8% therefore 7 200 00x8 / 100 = 576000 BIF so just 345 USD.  c.	Contribution to the death Guarantee Fund D: 1% of the amount of the credit (to be paid on the day of granting credit) non-refundable. Suppose that there will be  any death we should have as incomes 300 000 x 1% x30x8= 720 000 BIF just 431 USD  So the loan of 48 000 USD for 8 cooperatives will generate an annual incomes of 7 189 USD+ 345 USD+ = 7 965 USD just 13 293 585 BIF  N.B: 1US Dollars = 1669 BIF (Burundi Francs)","","Yes","10 000 000","2%","BCB ( Credit Bank of Bujumbura","5 991","2%","BCB ( Banque de credit de Bujumbura )",""

We are legally needing to do another equity round by end of June 2017 and will be cash liquid afterwards. We can discuss immediate repayment upon the completion of the equity round.","","Currently SafeMotos is funded by investors. To date we have raised 120,000 USD in a seed round and an additional 80,000 USD in a convertible note.  Currently, we are raising 150,000 USD as another convertible note, with 110,000 USD committed. Rather then complete the full convertible note, we would prefer to close at 110,000 USD and have Kiva fun the additional 40,000 USD.   Raising investor capital in Rwanda is very challenging and the terms we have on this current note are very generous to investors, while being not optimized for SafeMotos own interests.  The current note has a 20% discount, which is fair, but a 1M cap, which we believe undervalues SafeMotos. Rather then use the convertible note, we would like Kiva's funds to cover the balance so that we maintain maximum equity of the company to use in future funding rounds.","We currently have a financial plan to get to unit break even by March 2017 and operational break even by July 2017. We will achieve this by increasing revenue per trip, building new features (as lined out in our 100 day plan) and better operational streamlining.","","Yes","","","","","","",""

We ship coffee to the US every two weeks, meaning we generate new revenue every two weeks. By the end of this year, we expect our monthly revenue to be between $15,000-20,000 per month. Assuming a grace schedule needed to incorporate the new roasting technology, source and procure green coffee, and ramp up demand accordingly, we will be able to start paying the loan back in bi-weekly installments alongside our current shipment schedule.","","This loan will allow Vega Coffee and our farmer-roasters to increase capacity and generate revenue. We currently have three small, high-tech coffee roasters at our facility. We need three more to meet incoming demand and we also need to purchase green coffee for the upcoming holiday season and beyond. The new roasting equipment will combine with the green coffee to create a higher value product immediately (roasted coffee), which we have a built-in and growing demand for through our website vegacoffee.com.   The breakdown is as follow:   1. 3 Sonofresco ADR-enabled Coffee Roasters -- (http://www.coffeetec.com/1_kilo_2_lb_Sonofresco_ADR_Profile_Roaster_p/06-1k-sonofresco-2lb.htm). Each costs about $4,500 (including shipping and import taxes). The roasters are manufactured in the US, so they are tax-exempt through CAFTA. These three roasters will double our current capacity.   2. $10,000-15,000 Green coffee sourced from women run cooperatives in Nicaragua. We work with amazing cooperatives including Prodecoop, Soppexxca and UCA Miraflor to source the best coffee in Nicaragua. This will allow us to buy 5,000-7,500 lbs of green coffee and give us a boost of supply as we enter the new year.   3. Netweigh Machinery -- (http://www.coffeetec.com/Netweigh_Actionpac_weigh_scale_system_p/13-actionpac%20netweigh.htm) This machine would allow us to weigh bags exactly and pack them. This is currently done by hand and takes an extremely long time. A netweigh machine would allow us to process more coffee faster, thereby increasing efficiency and generating more revenue.","Our roasters are currently running at capacity, nearly 12-15 hours a day. In order to ramp up production as the holidays come and as we continue to grow through 2017, we need more roasting capacity, better machines and a greater supply of green coffee. The best part of this loan is that a very large percentage of both the initial loan spend and the resulting revenue go right back into our target community, maximizing our social and financial impact on women coffee growing communities in Nicaragua.
