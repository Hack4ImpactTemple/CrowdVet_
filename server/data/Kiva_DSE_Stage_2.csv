Market research has shown there is a growing market for unique handmade home décor products particularly in the high-end segment.","As a result of AAA’s years of experience developing on-the-ground operational teams, training large groups of artisans, and working with experienced designers, the Company has secured national retailer accounts developing a unique capability to produce and ship thousands of consistently high-quality products every month directly into high volume US and European markets.","All Across Africa has over 500 wholesale customers of which our largest and most consistent customers are: Costco, FTD, Ethan Allen, Paper Source, and One Kings Lane.

We operate differently providing total visibility and empowering our tailors and partners through visible fair trade practices, so they can be lifted out of poverty. We also provide opportunities and a platform for emerging ethical designers. By owning our tailoring centre we can guarantee a DNA of fairness that is shared with consumers via our two e-commerce sites www.Visible.Clothing, www.EternalCreation.","We own our own tailoring centre and provide visibility into every aspect of how clothes are made. From the people behind the products to the pricing and the tailoring process we provide complete access. We guarantee that all tailors are able to provide for a better future for their families, and work in an inclusive environment that is fair, safe, and non-exploitative earning a dignified living regardless of their race, caste, religion, gender, or age.","We are a USA company with a tailoring centre in Dharamshala, India. The majority of our production partners are also in India. The artisan and clothing sector is the second largest employer in the developing world. We have two e-commerce sites, www.EternalCreation.com caters to the seasonality of the southern hemisphere and the Australian market; and www.Visible.Clothing is an ethical fashion marketplace that caters to the rapidly growing demand in the northern hemisphere.","Visible People - We provide personalized order updates & live feeds so customers can see who made their clothes.
 Visible Products - We produce to order, storing fabrics and patterns from multiple designers/brands maximizing choice and minimizing waste.
 Visible Pricing - We breakdown costs so customers can trust that their purchases make a difference.","Visible is supported by our 7,000+ customers, 50+ wholesalers, 200+ crowdfunding supporters, and four convertible debt investors. We have 4 strategic women empowerment partnerships based in India - Freeset Fabrics, Hand Knitting Ladies of Gamru, Handmade Recycled Paper Workshop, MasterG Design & Skill Development . We also have a number of strong connections with emerging designers, and western based design schools.",Our biggest risk is managing external relationships. www.Visible.Clothing provides exciting opportunities for new designers and so is reliant on new designers wanting Visible to produce for them. www.EternalCreation.com is an established brand but needs to expand its customer base. The Indian government may adopt policies that create difficulties and additional costs to export clothing.,"Visible is a unique company because it bought an existing brand and tailoring facility (hence the slightly unique numbers in the financials with most of the initial convertible debt being used to pay the previous owner). Over the past two years we have done an overhaul of the production facility with a desire to bring in more brands and entrepreneurs to the ethical clothing sector.  
 Our goal is to radically alter the clothing industry. This partnership with Kiva will allow Visible to expand its presence in the sector while bringing in additional tailors, entrepreneurs, designers, and partners.

Wholesale customers purchasing through agents pay within 30 days of receiving the order.,"All our fabrics are locally sourced and include organic cotton and repurposed fabrics. We are a zero waste production facility and  therefore we regularly analyse sales data to offer new fabrics in our new and existing styles. We also regularly launch and test new styles from other designers, partnering with, and sourcing fabric from organisations that share our values of employing women and the marginalised.","Our invoices are paid within the time limit agreed with suppliers, which is usually 30 days. There has only been one situation when this wasn’t achieved due to a variety of factors, mostly external and a payment plan was agreed to, which suited both parties.","We have KPIs in 4 categories - a) Sales & Revenues; b) Operations & Production; c) Zero Waste & Environmental and d) Social impact on workforce. Our primary goal is to grow a workforce of happy and motivated tailors. The more ethical clothing that is sold, the more customers are able to buy in line with their values and the more workers can be treated fairly. This allows for them to receive medical care, payment of school costs, and training.","We currently employ close to 50 people at our tailoring centre and impact 50 more through partner organisations, who love what they do, are motivated to excel, and take great pride in their work. We have a team culture that fosters collaboration and respect. We provide a safe, fair, and steady work environment where inclusion is mandatory and people feel empowered. Through our fair trade committee and an anonymous suggestion box, we encourage our tailors to voice their opinions. We provide healthcare, pay 50% of the school fees for every child who has a parent at our tailoring centre, equip tailors with training and skill development, provide paid annual leave, annual bonuses, and on-site nursery care.","Working with a variety of new designers we will be able to bring more entrepreneurs and brands into the sector and increase the number of customers able to buy in line with their values. We plan to grow the number of tailors we currently employ, allowing us to provide more dignified jobs, free of exploitation, to double the number of tailors we have in one year and triple that number in two years.

 Every step of production at Visible has a DNA of fairness. Visible’s fabric is ethically made or sustainably sourced, by partnering with organisations and companies like FreeSet. 
 Next, Visible works with partner organisations such as MasterG, which provide job training skills. Women who graduate from this program can then work for Visible Clothing as a tailor earning a dignified living. 
 Then, our tailors and partner organisations take any excess fabric from our designs and turn that waste into beautiful notebooks, rugs, and hairbows. The entire process from start to finish is done ethically, just the way the clothing industry should work. 
 This loan will help continue to fund this movement to put an end to exploitation in the garment industry. Alongside Visible Clothing Company’s partner organisations, women will learn the skills they need to become master tailors and artisans and earn a living they are proud of.
 The women we employ now have the freedom to have a family and work, since we provide on-site childcare, they also feel safe and valued. We’d be happy to share stories of our tailors and in the meantime, you can meet our team here: https://www.eternalcreation.com/pages/whomademyclothes.",Artisan

 Market: Commodification of moringa","MoringaConnect’s mission is to improve lives through the moringa tree- a crop known locally as ‘the miracle tree’ for its nutritional, medicinal, and economic value. Starting in Ghana, we’ve built the first vertically integrated supply chain to improve farmer livelihood and turn their underutilized moringa seeds into clean beauty products under our award-winning True Moringa brand and their moringa leaves into nutritious beverages and snacks under our Minga Foods brand.
 We connect farmers to the technical training and agriculture inputs they need to grow moringa well; teach them how to integrate moringa leaves into their everyday diets combating rural malnutrition; serve as a guaranteed market for the seeds and leaves, increasing their incomes by 4x-10x; produce moringa seed oil and leaf powder using a proprietary process in Ghana; 
 and distribute our products wholesale and under our retail brands in Ghana and for export to seven countries.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/3948972983846543101/%5BKiva%5D%20MoringaConnect%20Deck.pdf,80,"MoringaConnect earns revenue by selling moringa oil and leaf powder products wholesale and retail. Our oil wholesale and retail business generated 94% of our historical revenue. In 2018, we will focus our oil sales on retail growth and grow leaf powder operations to fulfill wholesale powder orders to clients in our $3M+ pipeline. In 2018+, we will also begin to commercialize our R&D using our oilseed by-products for waste water treatment and plant-protein food applications.",30,"Historically, we've worked with a decentralized network of households and farmers. In 2017 we launched a nucleus farm to provide a centralized irrigation and inputs to ensure our farmers' yield and get their produce certified organic. This farm allows us to supply moringa leaf products in addition to our oil products.

Jibu creates opportunities for a network of African social entrepreneurs to open branded storefronts to provide underserved urban communities with safe, affordable water, creating quality jobs for women and youth in the process. ","At the core of Jibu’s product delivery and distribution network is the innovation to integrate franchisor and financial services. We have quickly scaled a network of locally owned franchises that provide premium, affordable water to underserved communities in Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya. Our franchise agreement ensures that our model stays strong: it allows us to revoke a Jibu license if a franchise strays too far from our business plan, values, pricing and more.","Jibu currently operates in Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya under our Corporate umbrella, and recently launched Zimbabwe and Tanzania under its Area Master Franchisor model.  We target the middle 70% of consumers in urban and peri-urban market. The rapid growth of the Jibu franchise network reflects strong customer demand from a vast market segment that, with the Jibu model, is newly able to afford safe drinking water.","There are plenty of bottled water brands in emerging markets, but Jibu is different. Challenging the notion that bottled water is a luxury product, Jibu offers consumers high quality drinking water packaged in an aspirational and convenient tap bottle at a price that is competitive with home water treatment methods, like boiling.","Jibu has a wide range of supporters from donors, grantors (like USAID) investors (like Danone Communities), and companies, universities and board members who support us with funding and expertise.","A franchisee who does not uphold quality controls or otherwise comply with our franchise agreement can damage our brand. Additionally, changes in local regulations and taxes can disrupt our model. We successfully challenged a recent proposed tax in Kenya and continue to monitor threats in each country, but regulatory changes are always a risk. ","Jibu means ‘solution’ in Swahili. We tackle the systemic roots of the opportunity and drinking water crises by training and capitalizing East Africans to be successful social entrepreneurs. We are built on a belief in the power of co-investment with local business owners. With access to the right model, support, and capital, local entrepreneurs are the agents best equipped to effectively and permanently solve many of the world’s social challenges in a lasting way. A Kiva loan will enable Jibu to launch franchises in the Democratic Republic of Congo, creating opportunities for local entrepreneurs and providing safe water to a population that has otherwise been unable to afford it.",,65,"Jibu fills aspirational and convenient bottles with great-tasting water at affordable prices. As part of our franchise agreement, we standardize prices across regions to ensure brand consistency and to avoid negative franchise-to-franchise competition. Our future sales strategy involves expanding indirect distribution through resellers, launching new product categories that reduce the up-front cost of the initial bottle purchase, and building capacity at franchises to create dedicated sales teams who focus on new customer acquisition.

Using a ceramic filter candle dirty water becomes safe to drink.  Filter costs just US$28 and last for 3 years, so besides improving health, we provide large savings. The filters are sold through 1)resellers (60%), 2) direct sales and women groups (20%)  3) exports (20%)","We specifically target women because there’s a disproportionate burden for women to provide safe drinking water to their families.
 To reduce the problem of expensive drinking water we target the 150 million Indonesians earning less than US$7/day living in peri-urban and rural areas.

,2018-10-31 17:22:17,KadAfrica Estate,eric@kadafrica.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ugandan beverage companies currently import passion fruit from Kenya and India for the manufacture of single and blended fruit juices. We estimate that the two biggest buyers in the country purchase between 66-114 tons of passion fruit pulp per year. This model supports non-Ugandan primary producers of passion fruit to the detriment of local smallholder farmers. We aim to displace this import-dependent model with a local supplier based model that benefits domestic market participants.,"Our business model creates passion fruit supply arrangements with approx. 1,400 girl youth and rural women farmers to feed a pulp processing facility. The girl youth farmers each produce 1.2 tons per year while the women farmers each produce 2.4 tons per year. These volumes generate 934.56 tons of pulp over a 12-month period, which would more than exceed the 114-ton requirement by our prospective launch customers. The surplus would be sold to commodities companies.","The global market for exotic fruits’ pulp was $645.3 M last year, with annual growth rates of 5.8% projected through 2025. Uganda produced approx. 990 MT of passion fruit in 2017. However, demand far exceeds supply, which creates the opportunity for neighbouring countries such as Kenya and the DRC to export surpluses here. East African beverage and commodities companies would readily switch suppliers provided required volumes could be met which is what KadAfrica would do.","KadAfrica's competitive advantages include domestic production and the international certifications we will obtain for our passion fruit pulp. This assures customers of adherence to the highest European mandated practices in our operations. Juice manufacturers enjoy cost savings in transportation and customs clearing, shortened delivery schedules, and better synergies than companies that currently dependent on imports.","Our partners include USAID’s Feed the Future Youth Leadership in Agriculture Project, which has agreed in principle to provide a Consultant that will study our current and planned supply arrangements prior to making a recommendation on pulp processing facility’s required capacity; and PUM, a Dutch organization providing a Consultant, this time to study prospective beverage/commodities companies’ current and expected demand in Uganda and regionally prior to making a recommendation on passion fruit pulp required volumes.","The risks include an unreliable supply chain and meeting stringent standards of pulp buyers. These are addressed through agreements with 20-40 rural women farmer groups to produce 1,200-2,400 tons of passion fruit yearly and producing pulp samples for prospective buyers prior to full-scale production. The loan is for running plant operations following arrival in Uganda.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/4168301301675987148/Passion%20Fruit%20Pulp%20Processing%20Business%202018.pdf,35,,2 weeks,,2 Days,Protected income increased for out of school girls in Uganda,"$ 97,640","KadAfrica’s programs are expanding rapidly and quality is important to us.

KadAfrica will, therefore, assist additional 500 out of school girls to increase income by 19%. 20% will have reduced instances of illnesses, 15% will have started using family planning, 33% will have increased the amount of food they eat in a day, and 100% will have access to menstrual hygiene products.

An average of 30 loans are taken in a month, paid back within a period of 4 months.",3065,"KadAfrica engages out of school girls in a number of ways. The girls are recruited and taken through a 6 months training, after which they start harvesting their passion fruit. Even when the girls are not harvesting, they are active in their savings groups. An important part of the program is our community outreach. For the program to be efficient we rely heavily on the support from the surrounding communities. We engage households by donating passionfruit seedlings. Each girl then assists her household in raising the seedlings at home. Each girl is also trained in how to pass on learnings from her training. In this way, girls become mentors within their communities.

Acceso and Exito are expanding their partnership to redefine commercial terms including increasing the volumes Exito sources from Acceso and developing socially branded products. Acceso is also incorporating new buyers.,38,"In 2017, Acceso purchased 4.4 million kg of product directly from smallholder farmers. Acceso operates community processing centers (for light processing and sorting) close to farmers’ plots and collection centers. The collection centers manage all disbursements of credit, seed, and other inputs. This ensures logistics and cost efficiencies by aggregating the sorting and selection of produce. Acceso also conducts quality control at the collection centers. Acceso then delivers products to buyers around the country.",15,"The most important social impact metric that the business tracks is beneficiary net income (we believe increased incomes allow farmers to better contribute to their families’ well-being and to lift them out of poverty). This indicator includes farmer sales to Acceso as well as to other buyers as the technical assistance provided by Acceso improves the productivity of farmers’ total crops, not just those sold to Acceso.","Social impact is embedded into Acceso’s core business operations through its continual, direct sourcing from smallholder farmers and fishers. Since the business started, beneficiary net income for smallholder farmers and fishers has increased substantially.Beneficiary net income (cumulative);2015: $754k; 2016: $2.2m; 2017: $4.2m","We expect beneficiary net income (cumulative) to be $7.2m by the end of 2018 and $20.5m by 2021. Acceso’s goal is not only to improve farmers and fishers’ livelihoods and to lift them out of poverty but to train and empower them to become entrepreneurs who are sustainable in their own right. Acceso plans to reach 2,000 farmers with whom it will directly source from (trade with) by 2020. 
 This loan will enable Acceso to purchase more produce from its network of farmers thereby further increasing incomes. With greater working capital, Acceso will also be able to test the extent to which it can reduce payment days to farmers and how that increases business revenues (and subsequently farmer incomes) through increased crop purchases.",Yes,,Number of jobs created,"As of 2017, the number of jobs created is 2400+, including farmers and farm workers. ","Based on this additional KPI, we anticipate to impact 3,688 people (including farmers and far workers) in the next two years. More than focusing on exponentially increasing the number farmers that Acceso works with, Acceso aims to significantly strengthen the current network of farmers and farm workers, improving commercial relationships with buyers and making sure smallholder farmers are equipped to increase the volumes and quality of their products to further increase their incomes.",,"Direct clients (farmers) are farmers that Acceso has purchased fruits, vegetables, or fish and seafood from and/or provided technical assistance to.

AHC now produces a range of 9 products and hence our tagline, “The Uniform People”.","We buy our fabric locally; we add value by manufacturing uniform locally. We sell directly to consumers which include corporates, schools and individuals. Uniforms are a statutory requirements for employers in certain categories (eg hotels) to provide protective wear for their employees and including schools.

By supporting sourcing systems that go beyond organic & fair trade in ways that are meaningful to farmers, we hope to break the cycle of poverty that fair trade premiums have not been able to fix. We provide market access for a supply chain built on these principles.","As a for profit company and manufacturer of our own product line and products of other companies we co-pack for, the impact of our sourcing commitments is inherently tied to the success of our business and our ability to purchase more materials from the farmers we aim to support. The more materials we can purchase, the more of an impact we can have. ","Our sales channels consist of two main areas: organic/natural grocery, and co-packing. For the healthy / free from chocolate category in organic/natural grocery, the expected compound annual growth rate is expected to be +2.6%, compared to +1.3% for regular chocolate (source: Euromonitor). Co-packing of similar chocolates should be expected to grow accordingly.","We are the only chocolate company that has made commitments to: 1) exclusively using agroforestry grown cacao to mitigate climate change, 2) exclusively using and innovating novel compostable film structures for CPG (consumer packaged goods) applications, and 3) taking real steps to addressing farmer poverty beyond fair trade.","For our own products, our customer demographics fall under the umbrella of LOHAS (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability). Aside from 200% top line growth, we have received numerous industry awards for the quality of our finished products, including ""best milk chocolate"" at the International Chocolate Salon Bar Awards, the first time this has ever happened for a dairy-free product. These types of awards and customer alignment allow us to attract similar co-packing clients.","Major risks include: seasonality of chocolate product sales in North America, which deeply impact our cash flow throughout the year. Additionally, as a bean to bar company we are required to making sourcing commitments to farmers for delivery of raw materials twice a year, which is a serious challenge we have to deal with. ","Endorfin Foods is a bean to bar chocolate manufacturer and co-packer based in Berkeley, CA. We aim to change the world for the better one chocolate bar at a time, by actively working on multi-stakeholder sourcing and economic development programs for farmers that we hope will define what the next step is beyond fair trade. Additionally, our work in developing compostable packaging options for the consumer packaged goods industry and in developing agroforestry-based sourcing programs will benefit all creatures on the planet, from the consumers that enjoy our chocolate to the plants and animals of planet earth.

This has been mitigated through the pre-study done on location showing its total potential and through the water-cleaning technology. Already,the plants are growing quicker than expected.
 Another risk may be payment delay from the smallholder growers’ technology kit contracts.","Due to its unique soil, water, and climate conditions, the agribusiness export industry in the arid coastal areas of Peru is booming and yet, the livelihood of local farmers is not. At EGA our mission is to change this by providing direct access to the global agricultural export market that has been dominated by big corporations, largely due to lofty capital and scale requirements unattainable for small and medium-sized farmers.
  
 How are we able to overcome these previously insurmountable obstacles? Through a unique blended business model involving both investors and local farmers. 
  
 First, to overcome the capital challenges, we have attracted local investors whose mid-size investment tickets (average of USD25k) are put to work to grow fruit to be exported to the northern hemisphere. EGA offers them long-term, turnkey management contracts to import seedlings from Israel, grow them at its nursery facility, transplant them and finally, harvest and export them with its future packing house facility, all to be done in an environmentally sustainable fashion.
  
 Second, EGA partners with local farmers who own and operate their own hectares, selling them cutting-edge technology kits adapted to local conditions and ongoing advisory from Israeli agricultural experts. In addition, EGA provides a 30-year guarantee to buy their produce minimizing individual farmer risk.
  
 Together the yield from impact investor and farmer-owned land combines to provide EGA with a quantity of produce substantial enough for export. It is through this model – many individual investors and farmers with just 1 or 2 hectares each – that investors and farmers alike are able to participate in this industry, and its gains, in a new way.
  
 The KIVA loan will be used to bridge the gap between the initial payment of growers/investors and a final payment, which is expected at the end of the nursery cycle and prior to transplant to the fields.",,4,"Technology Kit Sales: growers associations, mining companies investing in agriculture with their stakeholders.

( 12 months period at the nursery).,"At this stage our financing is only for the nursery and we already imported from Israel the Wonderful Pomegranates patterns. We have 52,000 plants growing at the nursery. We sell at our premises and do not need to use transportation. In two years time, we will have partnerships with logistics companies to export through the Arica Port in Chile ( 50 km away from our future packing house at Zofratacna-Peruvian Free Trade Zone facilities).",We pay cash in 30 days to our suppliers.,"Farmer Impact:  Track the evolution of the number of farmers incorporated, trained and through their increased interest. Through surveys, conferences and income levels we will have a qualitative and quantitative approach to see the overall impact of EGA as a company and pomegranates as a potential income source for them.","Organically we have already trained and incorporated over 25 families /farmers. We are planning to do conferences and initiatives for farmers in which we will show all the benefits and see the evolution of their interest by analyzing the conversion ratios from these events. The next event is in July and we expect to incorporate 15 new farmers, an increase of 50% from our last event. Our experienced Community Manager makes trips to visit the farmers and their respective valleys on a regular basis. In the near future we will have higher impact KPIs based on the effects of EGA in the region of Tacna and Peru as a whole.","Right now, we are forecasted to reach 200 Has from at least 100 family/ farmers and 40 to 50 impact investors by the end of 3 years. We hope, however, that we will exceed that and reach 300 Has by that time increasing our impact .

 Tacna due to areas with contamination. We are showing how to minimize the

 •	lack of data for reporting purposes to both contractor (AgroCorporate) and funders
 •	lack of credit record for Smallholder Farmers (SHFs)","GFM was born out of discussions with Nandos around their desire to increase SHFs in their supply chain but their lack of confidence in the rudimentary tools that Ag SMEs use to manage their farmer networks.  More subsistence farmers can become contract farmers and earn an income for the first time, through GFM's digital solution that enables more efficient and effective management. AgSMEs pay a setup fee, training and annual licenses and hosting.","GFM is based in South Africa with clients in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Tanzania. In Africa alone, nearly 850 million people or 70% of the population rely on small scale farming for their livelihood and smallholder farmers produce around 80 percent of the food that we consume.  However, a majority of the over 30m SHFs in Africa live on under $2 a day.",GFM focuses on digitizing and lowering the cost of farmer management systems and impact assessments in Ag supply chains as well as access to finance for SHFs. The GFM system allows AgSMEs to meet the criteria of food corporates and the ethical standards for different stakeholders while accessing liquidity to increase their farmer networks.,"AgSME, also known as aggregators, are GFM’s primary customer. Large food retailers i.e. Nandos are also customers as many are keen to include SHFs in their supply chain. The Hivos Food & Lifestyle Fund in the Netherlands are GFM's seed investor and have provided two rounds of funding."," The major risk in our business is that we are busy re-developing an enhanced version of our product.

 GFM provides a technical solution that enables SHFs access to market by replacing AgSMEs’ existing pen and paper systems. Large food corporations want to increase SHFs in their supply chain but lack confidence in the rudimentary tools currently used to manage farmer networks.

 We are trying to solve a surprisingly huge and complex problem: how to make small value loans like $100 profitably and at scale to the millions of poor people in Africa; the banks and microfinance institutions cannot do it with their cost structure.
 
 We solve this problem by digitizing the centuries old system of savings and loans used throughout Africa (called tontines in Francophone Africa) in order to provide access to services like small loans and micro-insurance. All transactions are done using mobile money and basic phones.
 
 Research has (e.g. portfolios of the poor) has shown that giving people micro-credit alone does not get them out of poverty.  You need to surround them with a range of services pertinent to their daily lives.

They are vulnerable to exploitation (sex trafficking, child labor, indentured servitude) and subsist in extreme poverty on less than $1.50/day.","By creating Prosperity Wage jobs, Yellow Leaf provides the foundation for revolutionary social change: a stable, middle-class income. Extreme poverty underlies a host of social ills (e.g., civil rights violations, environmental degradation, denial of education, malnutrition & disease). This tremendous income boost empowers weavers to improve conditions for their families and community, breaking the cycle of poverty. Weavers value the independence and fluidity of their work, which allows them to preserve essential cultural traditions.","Yellow Leaf is disrupting a stale category.

Rice straw is perceived as useless; the common means of disposal is open burning, which releases more than 20 million tons of toxic GHG emissions annually. This gas creates severe health and environmental consequences for Vietnamese communities, causing  Vietnam to be one of the top 10 countries most affected by climate change.","Fargreen's model is based on a closed loop production process – a unique technique that uses rice straw to produce edible mushrooms so that no net waste is left at the end of the production process. Rice straw is diverted from burning to mushroom production, generating large positive contributions to the environment and to community health.","We operate in Vietnam. Mushrooms are a key ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine. However, the need of a locally-sourced, branded, high quality mushroom product hasn’t been fulfilled and dominating by low quality products mainly imported from China. This is currently about a US$90M market, and expected to go through significant growth as Vietnam develops over the coming years.","Apart from the beautiful back end story, our mushroom product is the first premium branded edible mushroom in the local market. We are the only one at the moment that specializing on producing gourmet mushrooms 100% on rice straw substrate without using any pesticides, fertilizers or chemicals.","Echoing Green, TED, Pace Able Foundation, Doen Foundation, Colorado State University, University of Washington, Brigham Young University, Hanoi University of Agriculture, Cross Fields, and many individual supporters who serves as volunteers, advisors and mentors all over the world.","Our mushrooms are grown naturally, thus their yield suffers a lot with the increasing sudden changes in the environment in Vietnam due to climate change. This in turn affects the consistency and volume of our supply to big commercial buyers like five star hotels where there's not much flexibility in term of ordering.","Fargreen is a sustainable agriculture startup based in Hanoi, Vietnam. Fargreen sells premium branded edible mushrooms that are locally-grown on a rice straw substrate – a medium which is currently considered waste and burned openly. Fargreen’s production uses no pesticides, fertilizers or chemicals, and uses potable water to grow the mushrooms. Fargreen offers consumers locally-produced, healthy, and branded mushroom products while making a positive impact on the environment and on the lives of rural farmers.
 
 Our Mission: to build prosperous and sustainable farming communities in rural Vietnam and around the world. We want to eradicate damaging environmental practices (like open burning of rice straw), and ensure that no farmer is left behind in poverty for choosing to stay with their land instead of moving to cities where there is more opportunity.
 
 Our Impact: To reduce environmentally-damaging agricultural practices. In order to reduce these behaviors, we increase and ensure income security for farmers. Read more about our environmental and livelihood impact here.  
 As of December 2017, over 70 tons of straw has been saved from burning and over 50 tons were diverted to mushroom production with Fargreen. It is estimated that we have reduced CO2 emissions by 250 tons (Socioeconomic and Environmental Implications of Agricultural Residue Burning, Kumar P., 2015).
 Hundreds of rural residents is benefited by cleaner air in Hung Ha district, Thai Binh province since our official operations there in 2014. 
 Over 50 farmers are directly benefited from our operations. This includes the 15 farmers who are currently in our network with an additional 50-100% income from mushroom production on top of their current income (which comes solely from rice farming), and around 40 others who gain income from participating in our supply chain from collecting rice straw to preparing the straw substrate to grow mushrooms with us.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/3975485858918616796/Fargreen%20strategy%20plan_22032018.pptx.pdf,10,,45-60,"Currently we work with individual farmer household to collect rice straw from their fields but this year with the need of collecting over 50 tons of straw, we will commercialize the process by contracting with farmer coops/groups.

 ","COMACO serves the interlocking needs of farmer livelihoods and conservation.  Over the past 14 years, COMACO has pioneered its approach across Zambia’s Luangwa Valley currently reaching 177,867 smallholder farmers across 67 chiefdoms.  Key principles of its approach include:
 1.	Community leadership is critical for developing and delivering realistic and scalable solutions for improved land and agricultural management. 
 2.	Market-based incentives drive farmer commitment to sustainable, low-impact farming and land use practices by improving household income and providing reliable supply of nutritious food for their families. 
 With these underlying principles, COMACO has developed a tried and tested model that combines a range of farmer support services with a commercial food-processing business. Each of its 177,867 farmers, of which approximately 2500 are honey producers, joins one of 71 farming cooperatives and signs a pledge to adhere to a set of conservation standards. Over 4000 lead farmers, reinforced by a weekly radio-based educational program, provide training designed to increase yields, conserve soils and forests, maintain local supply of quality seeds, and reduce post harvest losses.

They are hindered by exploitative markets, lack of access to credit, erratic weather patterns, and elevated levels of economic vulnerability to unexpected events. Their vulnerability is due, in great part, to their sole reliance on subsistence farming of staple crops, mainly maize, beans and in some areas coffee. ","AESA business model consists in providing smallholder farmers in rich biodiverse areas with an alternative economic activity- beekeeping. AESA provides them with the technical training and the organic certification that allows them to enter high paying markets in Europe and Asia. By working with AESA, farmers can increase their incomes by 50%. Moreover, research shows that beekeeping is linked to increased crop yields due to pollination, thus farmers also benefit from an improved crop productivity.","AESA is based in Nicaragua. While the demand for organic honey is growing in international markets, Nicaragua is still the smallest producer of honey in Central America with the a current production of 500 tonnes per year, representing only 1% of European imports. The country’s potential remains untapped despite its large size and adequate ecological environment for this activity. Recent research shows Nicaragua is home to 30,000 beehives and has the potential for 300,000 beehives.","First, we are the only that is certified organic brand in the local market, allowing us to produce high quality honey under the most ethical standards and share the profits with the beekeepers in our supply network. Second, we are also beekeepers and understand the challenges of producing honey.","AESA is a private for profit family owned company. AESA is part of the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative, and Fledge, an accelerator program founded in Seattle, Washington. ","The main risk in the beekeeping business is climate change, as changes rainfall patterns, lack of blossoming, and therefore pollination are factors beyond our control, yet have a huge toll on yields. Another risk associated in beekeeping is theft, as our hives are located in remote regions that are difficult, and expensive to monitor.","AESA is a social enterprise that creates opportunities and improved livelihoods in rural communities through beekeeping, honey products and pollination services.
 We strongly believe beekeeping is a catalyst for holistic progress in the communities in which we operate. Through our activities, we generate positive environmental and social impacts in the most vulnerable areas of Nicaragua.

Despite dramatic declines in the cost of solar assets, a lack of high-quality solar developers makes businesses reluctant to switch from diesel, as they may not trust solar and they lack good local market examples of effective solar systems for business.  Financing is an additional obstacle.  ","We bring best practices to a customer-centric solar development business.  We market and design solar systems for businesses.  We use local installers and local talent in general, as much as possible, to help build scale in the local solar ecosystem.  In some cases we also provide long-term financing.  (We are not providing long-term financing for the UNICEF system.)","Our first market is Haiti, where grid power is so poor many businesses prefer not to use it at all.  Less than half the country is connected to the grid and the grid is up less than half the day.  There is a quite developed market for diesel self-generation.  Besides being dirty, diesel is risky since the government is under great pressure to reform a broken energy policy that keeps diesel prices artificially low.","In Haiti, we have no competitors so far.  There are solar EPCs who market solar systems but their businesses grow slowly because customers view them as just trying to maximize revenues.  No one offers solar finance except for 10Power and no one offers impartial solar development unrelated to a given EPC.   ","We are pleased to have signed recently a contract for our largest system to date, a 130kW system for the Haitian headquarters of UNICEF, representing revenues to 10Power of $686,083.  UNICEF are paying us cash 30 days in arrears for equipment and labor.  We received $100k investment from the Force For Good Fund as well as $525k of angel investment from individuals.","Business model risks: Haitian macroeconomic, environmental, and political risk; customer-specific credit risk if applicable; currency risk; and technology risk.  The Kiva loan however would have none of these risks.  The risk of the loan is if suppliers and/or shipping companies fail to create and deliver equipment and insurance fails to pay for such loss.","10Power catalyzes solar markets in geographies that lack electricity today. Developing and financing commercial and industrial solar projects in Haiti, 10Power works with local installers, sources world-class technology, provides engineering resources, and generates economic opportunity by helping businesses save money and run on reliable, clean energy. We incorporate gender inclusion and female empowerment into all we do.  The loan is impactful as it would help us perform excellent execution of the UNICEF project, which is critically important to UNICEF and critically important to 10Power's business rollout.",,5,We have local sales professionals and an active network in the Haitian business community.  We receive many in-bound inquiries such that our pipeline is very large.  There is significant pent up demand which we expect to rise.  Two high profile projects coming on stream in Haiti are likely to create even more interest in commercial scale solar.  One is for the US Embassy (we are not involved) and the other is our project for UNICEF.,"UNICEF notwithstanding, normally this is zero as we take enough cash upfront to cover equipment purchases.  For deals we finance, customers may have up to 10 years to final maturity.",This is by design flexible as we are technology agnostic and choose the best supplier for a particular job.  We have existing relationships with key manufacturers and follow closely the market for new products and approaches.,"This varies.  For UNICEF, we pay some suppliers in advance and some on delivery (~60 days)",GHG avoidance,"GHG emissions avoided to date are 79,500 lbs CO2, equivalent to 935 tree seedlings grown for 10 years.    ","Over the next two years 10Power will increase our impact by more than 10X. We currently have two projects underway that are orders of magnitude larger than the DloHaiti installations with Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and UNICEF. Cumulative savings from these projects will be $3.5 million and 18.7 million lbs CO2 emissions avoided equivalent to 219,825 tree seedlings grown for 10 years.",Yes,,"Jobs created, women employed, secondary social benefits.

Customers are desperately in demand of an alternative- and solar is a cheaper and better option. Colibrí is Nicaragua's first renewable energy utility company, installing rooftop solar for the ""mass market""-- everyday households and small businesses who stand to gain by using solar energy. Colibrí offers a seamless installation and financing process and lifelong technical servicing so that the customer always feels confident and content with their choice in their energy and expenditures.",,4,"We employ a salesforce that engage small businesses owners and homeowners to sign up as Colibrí clients.

Lack of domestic supply of honey, as most honey that is consumed is imported. 2. Proliferation of adulterated honey 3. Demand for honey is much higher than current supply. ","Tilaa’s business model is to source honey and honey byproducts (bee wax and jelly) from smallholder farmers and their own nuclear farm, process and package the products, then sell to business customers. The honey from smallholder farmers will be purchased for GHS 25/1kg, the wax for GHS 40/1kg. The social impact is primarily made from working with the smallholder farmers.","By 2022, the global market for honey is expected to be 2.4 million tons due to consumer’s increasing preference for natural products instead of artificial sweeteners. The current competitors in Ghana are Atlas Foods Ghana, Wisesimn Honeycomb Enterprise, Honey Tree Bee Farms, and Uplife Co. Ltd.",Our business is better than the competition because 1. We have access to a larger volume of honey from its smallholder farmer schedule.2. The quality of honey and its by-products is ensured by monitoring and evaluating each part of the value chain 3. The production process allows for an expanded product line.,"Tilaa has enjoyed support from both corporate and individual consumers. These include hotels, restaurants and retailers .the company operates from equity investment from its directors.","The two major risks associated with this business are: Exposure of bees to pesticides and China’s aggressive trade influences. bees, are exposed to pesticides and pesticides when they travel for nectar. China is the world leader of honey production and has massive economies of scale, leading to lower cost and an ability to sell.","The populates of the operational areas of the company are mostly peasant farmers, whose lives depends solely on their farm produces.unfortunatly,we have only three months raining season in the whole year. in order to make good use of the favourable conditions for bee keeping. Farmers keep bees to complement their income.unfortunatly,access to market is a big challenge to them. Since their products cannot compete with the imported once. Due to packaging. Tilaa is therefore buying from these smaller holder farmers for repacking which can compete favorable with the imported once.

Most farmers can't afford to own their own machine, but they can afford to pay for tractor services. When available, tractor services are a fraction of manual labor cost and more efficient. Unfortunately, tractor service providers are disorganized, lack business management tools, and have little visibility into what their tractor fleets and operators are doing in the field.","Hello Tractor has developed a fleet management solution that provides tractor owners with powerful insights to ensure tractors are both profitable and properly maintained. We glean insights from our low-cost monitoring device, which can be fitted to any tractor in the market. Through our mobile and web apps, tractor owners receive full reporting on tractor and operator activity, performance and maintenance needs of a tractor. ","Hello Tractor works in emerging markets where farm size tend to be small. Given the average size of plots (1.1ha in Nigeria), mechanization rates are lower as farmers can't afford to purchase a tractor. Tractor horsepower also tends to be lower because these machines are more cost effective in emerging economies. Manufacturer profit margins are razor thin and have stifled innovation within the low-horsepower segment creating a gap for Hello Tractor to fill.","Hello Tractor is the first company to develop low cost sensors for the sub-100Hp tractor segment. As the first mover in this underserved segment of the market, our strategy is to invest in product innovation and take risks to improve features on our platform. ","Hello Tractor has established itself as the preeminent technology provider in the low-horsepower tractor segment, selling over 500 units of our monitoring device and software packages and onboarding 85% of the new tractors sold in Nigeria. Our customers including leading tractor association, tractor dealers, tractor OEMs, and private agricultural companies. We have received funding from USAID to support our growth and impact.","Working in emerging markets presents challenges in doing business, political unrest, insecurity, and barriers to reach skilled labor. It is our belief that any agricultural business should include de-risking measures as a fundamental component of it's model. Hello Tractor has successfully leveraged the large donor and multilateral market to assist in this de-risking process.",Hello Tractor connects tractor owners to farmers through an Internet-of-Things (IoT) digital solution that bridges the gap between traditional farming and more technologically advanced approaches. Our platform simplifies complex data to make tractors profitable as business assets even in smallholder farming systems. This disruptive technology holds the potential to increase agricultural productivity and farmer income for a more secure global food system.,,2,"Due to the nature of our products and business, our ability to grow in any given country is largely dependent on new tractor sales.

Drinkwell addresses this problem by providing a modular “Stack” solution DWASA can retrofit onto its pumps to provide safe water directly to low income households thereby disrupting water sharks.","Drinkwell's business model involves four stages: (1) Evaluate raw water quality report; (2) Design system; (3) Build a turnkey solution whose capital cost is financed by a donor, government agency, foundation, or entrepreneur (4) Operate the system directly with an onsite caretaker who handles end user cash management, conducts daily backwash, liaises with Drinkwell's service team to address issues and minimize downtime in exchange for a monthly service fee.","Dhaka WASA’s master plan of a ""Digital WASA"" includes providing safe water to low-income communities currently using unauthorized connections as a priority it would be like to scale in Dhaka city, the most densely populated city in the world at 16 million people and 40,500 people per square kilometer. The Dhaka WASA Managing Director has committed to financing operating costs of 300 systems on a monthly basis if they are installed by December 2018.","Drinkwell’s competitive advantages against Grundfos include: (1) Lower costs - Whereas Grundfos’ solution is sourced from Denmark, Drinkwell’s components are sourced from Kolkata and Bangladesh (components are received within 2 weeks); (3) Dedicated after-sales servicing team – Drinkwell offers a full-time, dedicated servicing team whereas Grundfos uses local dealers who take longer to resolve issues.","Drinkwell is honored to count the largest water-related government agencies and foundations including Dhaka WASA, Wateraid & Dhaka Ahsania Mission in Bangladesh as well as Tata Trusts, West Bengal, Bihar, and Maharashtra Public Health Engineering Departments in India. We have received grants from Echoing Green, US State Department, India Department of Science & Technology, MassChallenge, and ImagineH2o. Our investors include high net worth individuals and impact funds (e.g., Sattva Capital, 1to4.ch, and Arun).","Major risks in our business model include setup delays due to how we need to source components for our ATM stack solution from India which may create delays in setting up the systems, as well as site selection delays due to reliance on single contractors for setting up the infrastructure thereby missing our milestones.","Drinkwell is transforming Bangladesh's water crisis into entrepreneurial opportunity by using a micro-franchise model to establish local water businesses in water-stressed communities. Drinkwell's uses proprietary nanotechnology technology that is half the cost of current market leader Reverse Osmosis, internet of things-enabled sensors, mobile payments, and locally-sourced components to provide turnkey solutions. Unlike existing safe water providers, Drinkwell provides onsite operation and maintenance services to ensure the system lasts forever and makes a margin on after-sales servicing payments as opposed to initial infrastructure sales thereby aligning with our customers long-term. Drinkwell is seeking a loan to finance working capital to setup 80 systems by October 2018. By providing affected communities with water filtration technology and business tools, Drinkwell taps into the entrepreneurial spirit within these communities to create jobs, generate income, and improve health outcomes. To date, Drinkwell's technology has seen over 230 deployments via 15 franchises giving over 250,000 people safe water with over 500 jobs created and zero reported cases of arsenicosis and fluorosis.",,37,For the Urban Bangladesh market we currently distribute our turnkey water solution through our own sales channel. We plan on expanding geographically across Dhaka city in bangladesh by directly working with the Dhaka WASA water utility and setup 300 pumps by December 2018; we have a large contract with Dhaka WASA that gives us exclusivity to setup 300 pumps by December 2018. Dhaka WASA pays us a monthly recurring service fee to operate each system.,90,"We import raw materials from Maharashtra and West Bengal India 5 times a year, we have a contract with Embark Water ATM that gives us a 10% discount with bulk order purchasing.

Specifically, Energaia seeks to address unsustainable food production; particularly livestock &amp;amp; meat production, as well as fresh water consumption. Energaia also seeks to provide a solution for the 1.8 billion people worldwide who do not have access to adequate nutrition, as well as provide a viable and sustainable business model for rural farmers around the world.","Energaia solves these problems by providing innovative systems for spirulina production, as well as a contract plus subsistence farming model whereby Energaia will buy up to 80% of the Spirulina produced by the rural farmers at fair trade prices while leaving the balance for household consumption to improve nutritional health.  Impact is made via recyclable systems, improving water / protein ratios, utilizing unused urban and rural spaces, decreasing greenhouse gases, &amp;amp; providing financing to farmers.","Energaia’s headquarters is located in Bangkok, Thailand. Current farming partnerships and operations are in Bangladesh, India, Singapore, France, and Thailand. The market for Spirulina is increasing year on year, with more interest from consumers in vegan and sustainable foods.  Global spirulina demand currently stands at 20,000 tonnes per year but we project it to increase to 20 million tonnes per year by 2050 in order to help meet the protein needs of the world.","Energaia’s production systems utilize a low-cost, closed system design resulting in a more efficient process which is better for the environment, better for society, and better for the farmer. Moreover, the spirulina produced by Energaia does not contain certain adulteration, which can be found in some other spirulina products, including heavy metals and dangerous toxins.","Energaia has received support in the form of cash prizes from DFAT/AusAID (Blue Economy Challenge winner), USAID (Bangladesh Tech4Farmers Challenge winner), Sankalp (Southeast Asia first runner-up), and Fish 2.0 (Southeast Asia track winner).  Equity investments were made in 2013. Distribution partnerships have been formed in Vietnam and Thailand.","Major risks are primarily environmental catastrophes, instability in local governments, unfavorable policy changes related to the export of food goods, or unfavorable policy changes related to repatriation of foreign currency.  All of these risks are deemed to be minor in Thailand where this loan will be used.","Global food production and consumption is currently undeserving humankind, and unsustainable for the world. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, 795 million people in the world today suffer from chronic nutritional undernourishment. Moreover, feeding the growing global population meat-based protein diets has a significant negative impact on the environment. Energaia is seeking to have a positive impact on the world by providing an socio-economic and nutritional solution to the world, while decreasing negative impact on the environment, primarily by displacing meat production, as well as fresh water consumption. 
 Energaia forms partnerships with underprivileged communications to provide a viable and sustainable business model through its innovative spirulina production systems. Loans provided by the Kiva organization will empower farmers by funding the production systems set up. Energaia provides guaranteed offtake agreements for the farmers to sell their spirulina at competitive prices, relieving the need for the farmer to need to make sales and marketing efforts or aggregation to meet large customer requirements, allowing the farmers to focus entirely on building, running and scaling their sustainable venture. 
 As more farmers are funded, Energaia focuses its efforts on supporting its farming partners, improving its products to be more efficient and impactful, as well as developing a large marketplace for spirulina in various sectors, including food, beverage, nutritional supplements, cosmetics, and even sustainable livestock feed.

In our case, we are addressing not only the tragedy of a common natural resource – coastal ecologies in Mexico – but the tragedy of the communities that overexploit these common resources. These communities live on the fringe of society, with little or no income, substantial illegal activity, drug and alcohol addiction, and pervasive hopelessness.","NOS engages with a fishing community, building resourcefulness, trust, communication, optimism, and cooperation. NOS and the community restore a nearby marine environment that has become depleted. A community cooperative is created, that receives an exclusive restoration concession from the Mexican government. After some years, the environment is able to support sustainable harvesting by the cooperative. Achamar buys the harvest, paying the best prices as well as (eventually) most of its dividends to community members.","Achamar operates in the Baja peninsula of Mexico, eventually throughout Northwest Mexico. Achamar’s seafood products are sold in Mexico, and Mexico will continue to provide 90% or more of revenues for the foreseeable future. Shellfish, and particularly penshells, are much appreciated and highly valued in Mexico.","Currently, Achamar has almost no competition; the species sold are not legally available elsewhere. Achamar will have 4-5 years to build brands, expertise and sales networks. Rather than branding based on the impersonal concept of sustainability, Achamar is branding based on the stories of the people who have restored themselves and their environments.","NOS has provided informal financial assistance to Achamar, as well as office facilities and back office support. In September 2017, Achamar received its first external financial support, a working capital loan from the ICF foundation. Achamar’s current equity base is minimal.","Until Achamar can source products from more than one community and location, it is at risk. The ICF and Kiva working capital loans allow Achamar to build up a track record which will attract long term financing in early 2018; if this long term financing is not received, the working capital loans are at risk.","Achamar is the final piece in a multi-faceted model that addresses failed fishing communities and their failed ecologies. Other important pieces are NOS (the community-development NGO), the communities themselves, and the regulatory and financial support of the Mexican government. Achamar is a necessary piece; without it, community cooperatives would receive low prices for their harvests, consigning their members to third-class citizenship status forever, and driving them to harvest more than environmentally sustainable amounts. The Kiva loan allows Achamar to attract long term financing during the next six months, ensuring the success of the model, and providing a strong financial platform from which to replicate the model in other communities and ecologies.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/3873726924423481199/Project%20Overview.docx,1.5,"Achamar sells frozen and fresh shellfish meat to restaurant chains and wholesalers in Baja and on the Mexican ‘mainland’. In March 2018, Achamar will also sell directly to consumers through its own kiosks and outlet. It will also sell live shells to restaurants. Large retailers will not be approached until Achamar has stronger brands and negotiating leverage.  Shellfish products are very well known and appreciated throughout Mexico; Achamar has no problem selling its products.","Receivables at the end of October 2017 were $6641, or 19% of the revenues for September and October combined. Generally, clients pay anywhere from 0 to 45 days after delivery. The larger the client, the more exigent the payment terms.","Currently Achamar pays prices for shells at least 50% in excess of what the harvesting cooperative could obtain on its own. As harvests increase, Achamar can pay lower prices upfront to harvesting communities, and more in dividends. Achamar is principally a marketing and financing company. However, over time it will build up its own processing and distribution capacity, to be able to handle 25-30% of its production.","Achamar pays its suppliers within a few days of receipt of an invoice. Payables as of Oct. 31 were equal to 49% of expenses; owners of the processing plant did not request payment, and the final processing payment to the cooperative had just been calculated.","Please see section III of the Project Overview, on Impact. Achamar is part of a systemic solution to a systemic problem, and is committed to sustained overall restoration of communities and ecologies. If independent interviews with community members indicate an overwhelming improvement in their lives over a period of at least five years, Achamar and NOS are doing good work. As a commercial business, Achamar is certainly accountable to its shareholders, employees, and customers; in addition and more importantly, Achamar is accountable to the community cooperatives that provide its raw products, directing as many funds as feasible to community members.","550 individuals have had their lives permanently and beneficially transformed. The first community worked with, El Manglito, has provided numerous extremely positive  testimonials concerning their restoration and the restoration of their environment. Achamar has only been operating for 2 months. It has an excellent reputation within the El Manglito community, which is aware that Achamar is directing most of its revenue to community members.  For 2017, 69% of Achamar’s revenues go to the El Manglito community cooperative, called OPRE.","Please see section III of the Project Overview.

 In addition, Acceso seeks to expand is fish and seafood business line in order to impact the lives of more aquaculture producers and fishers. To do so, Acceso is exploring the possibility of operating a larger tilapia processing facility. 
 Acceso is currently processing 22k lbs of whole tilapia per month in its small processing facility, Acajutla, that is only able to process a maximum 33k lbs of whole tilapia per month. The largest supplier of tilapia in the country (as well as Super Selectos’ largest supplier) is withdrawing from the market because of working capital issues, leaving a large unmet demand for 105k lbs of whole tilapia (35k lbs of tilapia fillets). Super Selectos has requested that Acceso increase its production to satisfy its full demand. 
 The existing supplier’s processing facility, Aqua Planta, is available for lease, and Acceso has negotiated use of this facility for a tolling fee of $0.10 USD/lb of fillet plus utility and direct labor costs for operations. With an annual production capacity of 4,000 MT, this facility presents an opportunity to satisfy Super Selectos’ full demand, as well as further expand production in El Salvador and export markets. Production costs under the negotiated variable contract structure are expected to be $0.73 USD/lb, as compared to a cost of $0.45 USD/lb of fillet for Acajutla.
 To expand its production and operate the processing facility to meet Super Selectos’ demand, an investment of $151k USD is required to support working capital. Of the total $151k USD required, Acceso is seeking $50k USD in the form of a Kiva loan to support a fish food input program for aquaculture producers in its network so that they can increase their production.",Yes,,Adoption of sustainable agriculture practices (The metric intends to capture the number of associations that received capacity building from the business during the reporting period).,"To date, the number of smallholder farmers adopting sustainable agricultural practices is 709.

As a result, these shops make poor business decisions and cannot grow. In Mexico alone there are nearly one million of these shops who together sell about half of all the food and beverages consumed in the country.","We have developed -- and continue to improve -- a point-of-sale software that runs on Android devices and has been designed specifically for mom-and-pop shopkeepers. This product helps shopkeepers make better business decisions. We aggregate the information collected from this software in order to sell business intelligence to consumer packaged goods company who today lack timely, granular and actionable information from this channel. ","Today we are working exclusively in Mexico where we have a national network of shops, some of whom have been in our network for 4+ years. We are actively growing our shopkeeper network through direct sales, social media campaigns and partnerships, among other strategies. We also continue to develop new products for our consumer packaged goods clients. ","Put simply, our product is the best in the market. Not only do we have very high Net Promoter Scores, but the high usage rates of our shopkeepers results in low customer turnover and highly reliable information. We are also constantly improving our product based on experimentation, customer feedback and data-driven analyses. ","In addition to our investors, we have a strategic partnership with a global data company who is helping us to monetize the data we collect from our shops. Most of our investors today are socially-minded impact investors. ","The main risk we face today is financial. Revenues are growing, but we need to continue investing in expanding our shopkeeper network and developing new products. We have a proven track record here but we need to manage our finances carefully so that expenses are financed through revenues and potentially new investment.",,,39,"We have two types of sales: to shopkeepers, and to consumer packaged goods (CPGs) companies. To shopkeepers, we are now selling our product directly throughout Mexico via referrals, social media and partnerships as well as offering incentives to those shops that use our software well. With CPGs, we are selling through a strategic partner which has deep relationship in this space as well as beginning a direct sales effort for new products.",45,"We have a supply chain today only for hardware, but we are changing it in two important ways. First, we continue to focus on finding cheaper tablets and barcode readers that are already in Mexico in order to reduce working capital requirements and purchase cycles.

Smallholder farmers constitute over half of the population and have limited access to capital to purchase improved seeds, quality fertilizer, or machinery to dry grain after harvest. As a result, average yields hover below 2 tons per hectare--far below the global average of 5 tons, and  around 30% of the harvest is lost due to poor post-harvest management.","Our model has five main components: (i) financial services, (ii) input distribution, (iii) extension & harvest services, (iv) post-harvest & storage services, and (v) marketing services. We track and measure impact via (i) cost savings provided to farmers; (ii) increased earnings through higher yields; and (iii) access to training on improved agronomic practices. Our farmers can save up to $75 per season on the cost of credit, and earn at least $50 more per season.","We sell maize to the local poultry feed industry, which consumes over 2 million tons of well-dried maize annually and pays up to 35% in premiums. Cameroon has 13 million maize smallholders, with average plot sizes of 0.7 hectares. By 2030, it should have 18 million farmers across five production zones. As demand from the feed industry grows and average maize prices increase, more smallholders are expected to grow maize.","Various entities provide some components of our model, but our unique package remains unchallenged. Middlemen lack resources  to dry grain for industrial use, and commercial lenders and micro-finance institutions lack the technical capacity to adequately, cost-effectively serve rural farmers,. Public extension agents are few, under-incentivized, and overworked.","Our initial financing has been from a group of angel investors and we have also been operating with funds from revenues and short term loans from family. We have not received funding from any major investors or foundations. We currently supply seven major companies with well-dried maize, each of them has the capacity to purchase more from us, with one customer’s annual demand surpassing 20,000 tons per year.","Our major  risks are farmer side-selling, loan default, crop failure, local conflict, and environmental hazards. The main risk involved with this loan is the potential for price volatility post-harvest. Mitigation strategies exist for each risk have been identified.",,,37,"Our sales strategy has been to sell 70% of our farmers’ crops to clients whose annual demand for industrial maize is over  20,000 tons. In 2018, we plan to reach  800 farmers, and work with 1,200 by 2019. Our production volumes would increase to ~2,500 tons next year and 4,200 tons by 2019. As we grow, we plan to serve farmers in other production zones and export grain to neighboring countries.",14,"We provide loans to farmers in the form of inputs, extension services, and mechanization services; and in return we are paid the amount owed plus interest in maize at harvest.

 The exchange rate in the DSE financial tool I received wasn't working for 2016, so i used an average rate of $1 = 600XAF to convert my currency to USD. It might be a bit off what you get on the financial tool for 2016. I didn't edit the tool, just did my own calculations to submit the application. 
 
 Also, our reporting is in French following the OHADA accounting code. I tried to convert some statements but wasn't able to convert them all. The statutory reports for 2016 is in French, however I sent the english version of the trial balance and ledger for the same period.
 
 Apologies for the inconsistencies.

The precision planter micro-doses fertilizer and seeds the correct distance and depth in 66% less time than manual planting, yielding 100% more food/hectare. Farmers pay for this planter using myAgro’s mobile layaway system. After using it on their own fields, farmers can rent out the machine and recover their costs in 1 season through rental fees.","myAgro works with over 30,000 farmers and will grow to 50,000 in the next year. We envision all our clients having access to a micro-dosing planter. Especially in Mali, agricultural tools are often sold only in urban areas, so most planting is by hand. Currently, myAgro precision planters are sold in 11 of our zones in rural southern Mali. In 2018, we will expand offer the planter in 6 zones in eastern and western Senegal. 
 ","myAgro’s precision planters are manufactured professionally and are better quality than competitors. Our planters are designed to micro-dose fertilizer, which increases yields. Additionally, we allow farmers to pay little by little (rather than requiring a large, one-time payment), deliver to the client’s village, give agricultural training, and provide a service plan for repairs.","myAgro has a core group of funders who have continued funding myAgro from early pilot stage to the current scale-up phase. This includes Mulago Foundation, Peery Foundation, Jasmine Foundation and Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation. Future funding will continue to be raised from these groups as well as new mid-size foundations for R&D and bilateral funding for larger scale.","General risks for myAgro are political instability in Mali and lack of availability of quality seed in Mali and Senegal. For this loan, it will be the first time myAgro has sold our precision planters in Senegal, so regardless of market research we can’t be 100% sure what the uptake will be.",,,341,"Precision planters are sold by myAgro's team of field agents, who each serve 4 villages, and work (and often live) in those communities year-round. Agents form close relationships with clients, helping farmers evaluate what products are right for them.

Ghana,,Accra,Greater Acccra,NM 240,Ghana,,,,,,,2014,Multiple shareholders,"Fruit processing companies and large retail companies in Ghana are facing a deficit in the supply of quality pineapples and vegetables, this compels most of them import from neighboring countries and as far as Europe. 
 
 At the moment the largest fruit processing company in Ghana, imports up to 40% of pineapples to meet up with its demand. Some retail shops import vegetables from South Africa, and Netherlands to keep their shops open.","Groital applies a producer business model  (B2B business model).  We cultivate and sell quality fresh pineapples and some vegetables (Cucumber, tomatoes, chili peppers and papaya) directly to fruits processing and large retails companies. 
 By virtue of irrigation, Groital solves the problem of shortage in pineapples and vegetables by producing on consistent basis, which is not commonly seen in Ghana as most farmers rely on rainfall patterns.","The pineapple market size in Ghana is worth $30M.  
 
 Groital has a signed a 3 year contract with a Swiss food processing company (HPW) located in Ghana for the supply of 20tonnes of pineapples per week (worth $560,000 in total), out this contract we are only able to supply between 10 to 20%. 
 Groital aims expand operation to supply at least 100% of the already secured contract for pineapples, by increasing the farm size.","Strategic location: 
 Groital is just 45 minutes drive away from two of the largest fruits buyers in Ghana, which allows for on time deliveries Irrigation: 
 About 90% of farms in Ghana are rain fed, meaning most of our competitors are only able to produce 4 months in a year. 
 T
 echnology, Management Team and Expertise:","HPW is our largest customer and buys all of our pineapples and have the supportive in terms of capacity building to ensure consistent quality of our produce. 
 In the past Mark Davies has invested in the business and currently acts as an adviser to the company. 
 I am currently participating in a accelerator program by MBC Africa. In 2016 Total Petroluem and Technoserve Ghana supported us after winning two awards $20,000 and GBP6000 respectively.","Drought:
 For this  Groital has invested in irrigation to minimize the risk
 Possible collapse of the market. 
 Diversification into various products gives a safety net should one product's market fail.

 We also supply to 50kg of vegetables ( Mainly cucumbers and/or chili peppers) per week to Eden Tree and Shoprite. In the near future we intend to expand our operations to cover the remaining 10 acres of land.",10 days,"All our basic raw materials are purchased locally at certified shops located at Nsawam, and transported to the farm using hired trucks. These same hired trucks are contracted as and when needed to deliver fruits and vegetables to your customers in the company of 1 staff member on the same day of harvest. 
 
 In the next 3 years Groital has planned to export some of its produce to neighboring countries using inter country haulage companies.",5 days,1. Number of jobs created. 2. Number of youth trained in farming. 3. Number of people provided with potable drinking water,"Each employee on the Groital farm program has a career development and improvement path, which we believe will prepare them for starting up their own farms at some stage. There is an annual review with management as to what targets for self improvement should be set, what areas of agric they want to learn, and a summary of progress on our online checklist each quarter. By the end of the year each employee ranks what they have learned in a report, and tracks their own personal development score in both business practice, technology, and plant cultivation. Currently Groital has 25 employees providing salary and revenues for approximately 20 different families of over 200 people. Starting in 2016, Groital has an internship program. So far we have trained about 50 students. The program is in collaboration with AYNAT (African Youth Network for Agricultural Transformation) who identify and recruit the appropriate candidates. The students then receive training both at their school facility and also in an internship program on the farm. The idea is to inspire young people that agriculture can be an attractive option and to combat the stereotype that it is non-techy, only for older people, or not financially lucrative. THe program consists of three parts: a) technology in agric; where we cover drones, solar water pumps, disease & pest management, phone app usage to manage farm records, greenhouse tech,   b) the business of agric: where we cover basic modules showing how much money can be made from an acre of farming, and cover the basic input prices required, including labour, and the output options and financial models possible.   There is also a community outreach program to support those in the immediate areas of Groital farming. This service has started with the provision of potable water to two communities that did not previously have fresh drinking water and has made a huge difference in the lives of approximately 150 people. As Groital matures and builds a solid financial base, these programs will expand to include contributions to local school facilities, housing and education. The start currently is small, reflecting the capacity of the company today, but will expand over time. Groital understands that it must give back to the community in which it is operating.   There is a program developed to create a public profile of Groital throughout the country to educate the youth about agriculture by setting an example of a highly successful tech-enabled agricultural business. The CEO will visit local schools, go to radio stations for interviews, speak at conferences, and raise the profile of the modern young Ghanaian farmer such that old stereotypes are changed and more young people are attracted to agriculture. The quarterly blog and social media tweets and facebook presence will all contribute to building an example of what modern African farming can do.    Groital team has tried to rethink the social impact program into a more meaningful and structured program and to move to a more rigorous approach. Given that GROITAL is based on using innovative technology in Agriculture, we feel this is something critical for the broader community to learn and implement on their own small holdings and other farms. The goal will be to structure this as a formal Foundation in the 5th year of business, and dedicate 5% of annual profits to the program.","In the next 2 years we want to increase our employment record to 50 people. Help train up to 200 youth in modern agriculture, and extend potable water to some 150 people.

Simple activities such as working, cooking or studying are complicated and potentially dangerous as people use kerosene lamps for lighting. Additionally, for families and local entrepreneurs, phone charging is an economic burden.","upOwa operates a rent-to-own pay-as-you go business model, enabling families and small shop owners to purchase a solar kit to power light and to charge phone and radio through regular mobile money payments. The client relationship includes an after sales-service 7 days a week during the repayment period. upOwa mission is to provide off-grid communities with affordable solar solutions.","upOwa operates in the rural areas of the West region in Cameroon. The data for the first 250 solar kits installed by upOwa shows that our beneficiaries are 95% living in rural areas. 63% are farmers and 14% are merchants. 63% earn between 42 000 and 70 000FCFA (68 to 113 USD) per month, 20% between 42 000 FCFA and 21 900 FCFA (35 to 68 USD). On average, families have 5.7 children.","upOwa is a better alternative in three ways : 1-we bring electricity to off-grid villages that are beyond traditional distribution channels 2- With upOwa's pay as you go offer, households and small shops can afford solar electricity. 3.) upOwa guarantees its solar kits for 2 years and we provide maintenance directly at the customer’s home.","We received support from several organizations and people both in Cameroon and in France. Locally we first received support from the mayor's association of the West region, then from Orange, the telecom company that provided phone credits as a part of its social responsability program. In France we received support from the incubator Green Tech Verte, an initiative of the Ministry of Environment in France.","The major risk is that our clients do not comply with the repayment schedule for their solar kits.

For about 640 million persons living with these limitations, their opportunities to join the prosperity of the rest of the world remain limited.

Political crises combined with rampant hyperinflation decimated the local manufacturing sector, forcing factories to make do with substandard inputs and long obsolete machinery. Resultantly, unemployment figures currently stand at over 70 percent with the worst affected being women and youth. Persistence of this situation for almost 2 decades from 1998 has led to low income earning potential for these vulnerable groups. ","Starting from humble beginnings over a decade ago Odzi Foods Industries (Odzi) is a home-grown Zimbabwe manufacturing success story. Odzi has invested heavily in building a robust supply chain of quality raw materials from both domestic & international suppliers while also training a highly skilled manufacturing workforce. With 17+ product lines and a network of 700+ small shops, Odzi is working in tandem with the ZIMASSET economic blueprint which supports value addition & good nutrition.","The market for non-alcoholic beverages and fruit and vegetable juices continues to show a positive outlook as the desire for healthy living grows.
 
 According to BMI Research’s Zimbabwe Food & Drink Report “Non-alcoholic drinks consumption will grow 1.3% in 2017 and its CAGR between 2017 and 2021 will be 5.2%” and “Fruit and vegetable juices consumption will grow 2.4% in 2017 and reach a CAGR of 9.1% from 2017 to 2021.”","By focusing on meeting the needs of consumers in a depressed-economy while not compromising on product-quality, Odzi performs better than most of its competitors. Odzi excels in offering more affordable products compared to brands such as Schweppes Mazoe & Lyons Quench and better quality products compared to brands such as Squish Squash & Sun Splash.","From a funding perspective Odzi has received support from Angel-Investor Marc Lorenz based in Hamburg,Germany. Since 2014 Marc has been making semi-annual trips to Zimbabwe helping the company scale to almost $1mn in annual revenue. Marc has been instrumental in assisting the company develop critical supply chains, budgets, strategies and more. Recently we have been offered a beverage filling line at no-cost from our bottle supplier PolyOak in recognition of Odzi’s great on-time payment record.","The current economic challenges have increased the risks associated with bad debts from credit customers. These risks are inherent to the business model as cash sales are also not currently viable due to prevailing cash/currency challenges.

Despite 80% of Ugandans off-grid and 10+ years of solar on the market, less than 5% of Uganda's 5M off-grid households have solar (2017). This is due to lack of access, affordability, and trust: transient, poorly-trained sales agents & no local after-sales servicing options, both caused by lack of infrastructure & human capital. Despite a growing solar industry & 60-80% unemployment, rural/refugee youth lack key skills.","Village Energy is boosting access, affordability, & trust in solar through our last-mile distribution & servicing network. We set up retail locations & train local youth as technicians & salespeople. Through product & customer financing partnerships, we offer everything from household products to large installations. Our one-stop shop model allows us to more cost-effectively operate in rural areas than other solar companies. We are also developing a traveling solar academy to create talent pipeline.","We operate in rural Uganda, with operations in 8 districts across the country (plus Kampala): Arua, Mbale, Masaka, Mbarara, Gulu, Soroti, Pallisa, Kumi. Three business units:
 1. Product Sales: Lanterns & D.light D30 PayGo home system, with a commission earned for each customer registered.
 2. Custom Installations/Large Projects: 2-years on-site maintenance built into all deals.
 3. Trainings: Main focus is piloting a grant-funded model, but we also generate revenue through staff trainings for other companies/organizations.","Unlike most solar companies, which started with a product or financing model and were forced into distribution, solving distribution/servicing is our primary focus. Our “one-stop” model contrasts with, but also complements, the industry trend of vertical integration. Where we innovate is people/logistics: how to recruit/train/manage a dispersed field team operating in multiple customer markets.","Over last two years we have been funded by USAID, SPRING Accelerator, Echoing Green and SEED. We are in talks with Philips Lighting Foundation about a grant to fund the training academy. We have also been selected by Energy4Impact as the refrigerator field testing partner for Global Leap Awards, involving 40+ installations, which is about to begin next week.","Biggest risk is that we run out of funding, but we are closing revenue gap every month, and with E4I deal and others in works, aim to be cash flow positive by EOY.  Other risk is that our model requires product/financing partnerships, so we need to diversify to prevent being too dependent on one partner.",,,33,"Our D30 sales strategy: 1. Partnerships with SACCOs/savings groups, as we can offer revenue sharing and high level of after-sales service for their members. 2. Field agent sales, who pick up inventory from our shops. Also setting up our own savings groups, of which we have 40+ groups formed. Installation sales strategy focused on rural areas, where we offer 2 years maintenance/servicing in every contract. This fund will be big part of strategy.",Lanterns: immediately. D30: commissions paid by end of month. Installations: payment plan of 6-18 months on 70% balance,"We procure all of our products and components locally: we have no plans to get into importation at the moment, but probably will at some point in next 2-3 years.

And how can Kenya’s participation in these industries bring social and economic benefits to local Kenyan communities?,Our business model is based on manufacturing and selling running shoes and apparel. We started by sourcing the shoe components in Asia and assembling them in Kenya as we slowly build to a place where 100% of the shoe is made in Kenya. Our running shirts and beaded bracelets are made in Kenya. 2% of all sales are donated to social causes in Kenya.,"Assembly of the shoes is done in Kenya and distribution and marketing are done in Kenya, Australia and the US.",We are authentic in two aspects: 1. Our design is inspired by the input and running style of Kenyan athletes; 2. Our customers get a chance to join the global Enda community where they meet other runners and also get a chance to vote on which local projects in Kenya should receive our support.,"Friends and family helped us raise the funds needed to get to prototype stage.

Box 40237-00100 G.P.O.,,Nairobi,Nairobi,100,Kenya,2016,Multiple shareholders,"We are addressing deforestation, climate change and poverty. 70% of Kenya’s energy comes from wood fuels. This demand is unsustainable – it is destroying Kenya’s forests at the rate of 52,000 hectares per year and exacerbating the local impacts of climate change. Firewood is also getting more expensive, particularly for schools, about 85% of whom use it for cooking. This increased cost requires higher school fees, which puts additional strain on poor families.","We supply schools with an eco-friendly and cost-saving alternative to firewood made from sugarcane waste. We source sugarcane waste briquettes from a sugar factory, perform quality control, package them, and distribute them under our brand name “Kuni Safi.” We are now the largest supplier of clean cooking fuel to schools in Kenya, with over 70 school customers. Every tonne saves 25 trees as well as an average of 35% on the school’s firewood budget.","Kenya’s wood fuels market is valued at over $500 million. Our primary target market of public secondary and private schools who buy legal firewood in 31 counties has an annual spend of over $21 million. We plan on expanding to serve the hotels/restaurants sector, an additional market opportunity of over $128 million. The market is currently served by many small, informal firewood suppliers and there are no other briquette suppliers proactively targeting schools.","We pack briquettes specifically for schools to select the quality and density that works best in institutional cookstoves. We offer a distinctive quality of service which customers value, including deliveries within 1-3 days, full-day trainings for cooks, and monitoring of the consumption to ensure the customer is saving money as well as fuel. ","We have partnered with the Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association and Kenya Private Schools Association to sell to some of the top schools in the country (e.g. Starehe Boys Centre). We also have sold to the Makueni County Government and Sarova Hotels, a leading hotel chain. We receive pro-bono advisory support from Energy 4 Impact, the Kenya Climate Innovation Centre, and Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. We are currently self-funded without external investment.","Long-term, other briquette manufacturers could start targeting our customers and undercut us on price; we will mitigate this through distinctive quality, brand recognition, customer loyalty initiatives, and long-term supply contracts. Short-term, poor hiring decisions or an economic downturn could slow our sales progress; we will address this through selective hiring, clear metrics, and trial periods.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/3788100293813768432/Acacia%20Innovations%20Executive%20Summary%20Aug.%202017.pdf,4.5,"We focus on customers who purchase a minimum of 1 ton at a time, so our distribution is always in bulk.

They are forced to use dirty, expensive kerosene lamps for lighting, and are unable to charge mobile phones.","BioLite develops, manufactures, and wholesales clean energy products to third party, credit-enabled distributors, targeting gross margins of 20-40%. These partners sell product to off-grid, low-income customers within their channels via consumer finance. BioLite comprehensively supports distribution partners by providing product demonstrations, customer training, and after-sales service. BioLite follows up with every customer by phone and/or household visit to ensure user satisfaction and measure impact (KPIs includes: CO2e averted, electricity generated, energy savings achieved).","BioLite engages households in Kenya and Uganda that earn $2-8 per day, live in rural or peri-urban areas, cook with biomass fuel, and rely on kerosene for lighting. 84% of Kenyans and 95% of Ugandans cook on smoky open fires, while 82% Ugandans and 44% Kenyans lack access to electricity; paying high prices for unclean fuels for lighting, such as diesel or kerosene. Taken together, we estimate that this population consists ~4 million households.","Whereas most clean energy companies develop products in a siloed manner (focusing on a single aspect of energy access), BioLite addresses multiple basic energy needs simultaneously. Through the HomeStove, we offer safer, cleaner, and more economic cooking; and through the SolarHome 620 we offer an ultra-affordable, market disrupting solar home system with premium features.","BioLite’s key distribution partners include: One Acre Fund and Juhudi Kilimo in Kenya, and FINCA in Uganda.

BioLite calls its dual market approach 'parallel innovation', a model by which BioLite serves customers in both developed markets (primarily outdoor enthusiasts) and developing markets (rural households living in energy poverty in East Africa and India) with products appropriately tailored to the customers' needs (inclusive of both price point and feature set considerations). BioLite maintains dedicated sales and marketing personnel by market and leverages a company-wide base of resources to support both business segments, including finance and operations infrastructure and a deeply technical product development R&D team. BioLite believes this model offers the opportunity to build a self-sustaining market-based approach to serving energy needs in developing markets. It also allows BioLite to professionalize its core disciplines across markets and leverage revenue and cash flows from the outdoor markets business to invest in the incubation of the emerging markets business. 
 
 Although a 'for profit', BioLite continues to invest significant resource into the impact work of the emerging markets business, and as a result is unprofitable as a company. These investments leverage the equity value created to date in the outdoor markets business, but require additional support from mission aligned partners to scale BioLite’s operation in challenging markets. Debt capital from Kiva would allow BioLite to invest in core infrastructure ahead of scaling activities, thereby enabling us to provide low-income, off-grid customers with the access to energy and clean cooking solutions that will change their lives.",

In the developed world, strained healthcare budgets are pressuring governments to decrease costs, and most amputees do not have adequate insurance to cover a high mobility device.","LegWorks designs and manufactures innovative and high performing technologies that are accessible and affordable to amputees around the world. We use a proven distribution model where we tier our pricing according to the country and channel to reach traditionally underserved populations.

This brings hardship on them since their only source of lively hood is farming. In the light of this the clients result to bush burning for bush meat.

Smallholder farmers cannot meet their cashflow needs without selling unprocessed coffee. Farmers sell unprocessed coffee to middlemen at less than 5% the retail value. Therefore, over 10 million smallholder coffee farmers are in a vicious cycle of poverty from one generation to another.","NUCAFE business model is the farmer ownership model. It is an inclusive business model, which enables smallholder farmers to retain ownership of more valuable forms of agricultural produce such as coffee to be able to increase their income by 250% per kg of graded green coffee. Farmers pay for a service fee to NUCAFE for mechanical processing and marketing their coffee. Farmers can then reinvest and also remain with disposable income their cashflow needs.","NUCAFE operates both in domestic and export markets. In Uganda, it operates where its primary customers (farmers) that use its services; processing and marketing. This is growing at 160% annually. Domestic market involves sale of roast and ground coffee and the coffee shop. The other NUCAFE market includes  exports to Europe (Italy, UK, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany), South Korea, China, and Japan. Annual World market growth has been 2% last ten years. NUCAFE growth is 133%.",NUCAFE’s business model gives opportunity to farmers to sell a more value added product that does not only attract better terms of payments but also partnerships of long term relationship. Farmers are masters of their own destiny. NUCAFE facilitates production and marketing of quality and traceable coffee from farmers to off-takers without taking over ownership.,"On one hand, NUCAFE’s largest customers are the 198 coffee farmers’ Associations and cooperatives who are members and use NUCAFE factory for processing farmers’ coffee and marketing service. On the other hand, there are also buyers who buy coffee through NUCAFE. NUCAFE has had support from donors (e.g Danida, USAID, TRAC, Agriterra, AVSI, ). These have supported NUCAFE to develop its farmer ownership Model and investments in a fully fledged coffee processing factory.","The major risks include untimely access to cheap working capital to synchronize with the coffee season.

SolKomYo provides solutions to these problems by providing access to critical technologies in marginalized communities in the northeast department through a network of local entrepreneurs.
 ",The Micro-Consignment Model designed to start a business from day one and provide access to much-needed products and solutions.  We work with a network of 25 female entrepreneurs who assess the priority needs of the community and respond by providing access to these technologies in remote areas and receive products on consignment. The model is two folded providing a stable income for the entrepreneurs while also helping to solve the priority needs of their communities.,"13 communities in the northeast of Haiti which is home to over 400,000 people. These regions have little to no access to technological solutions. Through our distribution model, we are able to reach remote Micro-Consignment that have little to no access to these solutions. People want and continue to ask for our technologies because they are creating a huge impact on their lives and families from savings, to health benefits, efficiency and more.",We have a unique approach because we invest in the females we work with to not only distribute the technologies but to assess their communities and understand what the community needs and priorities are.  By building their capacity they are able to become leaders in their community while also receiving income to support their families.,"We are supported by our strong local network, including community organizations, schools, and institutions. Financially, we have received support from the IFC and the Levi Strauss Foundation. We are also part of the sister network, Community Empowerment Solutions, which helps us to develop innovative cross-cultural solutions to support the work. ",The greatest risk within our business model is the currency devaluation. The currency exchange rate from US dollar to gourde fluctuates periodically. We are working to develop a system that is more adaptive and is not affected by these fluctuations.,,,25,"The entrepreneurs we work with conduct community assessments to understand the market and their clients and hold campaigns to spread awareness about the benefits of the technology and promote the product within the community. In the future, we plan to strengthen the program by investing further in our entrepreneurs to develop professionally their business skills, leverage their relationships within the community, and sell their products in a 3-month period.","Since the start of our operations we have sold over 10,000 products including solar lamps, water filters, stoves, and eye glasses.  We collect the sales reports and money from our entrepreneurs every month. Each time an entrepreneur makes a sale 5 to 10 % of the sales price goes towards their compensation and the rest is reinvested in new inventory.  We limit the time that the entrepreneur can keep the products for a period of 3 months so that we don’t end up with dead stock. At this time, we redistribute the products that the entrepreneurs have and focus on areas where demand is high.","With our distribution model already in place, we supply our products from an organization in Haiti that has quality products(d.light, Barefoot Power, Haiti Metal). We also source products from various leading organizations, such as Vision Spring, Total, and MadiDrop.",We pay our suppliers at the moment of purchase and our entrepreneurs the day that they bring their monthly reports.,"We calculate the net economic impact (NEI) of each product which represents the economic impact the product generates in the lives of the clients once they have purchased the product. To date our NEI  is over 1 million USD. We also calculate the number of beneficiaries as the number of people who have direct contact with a product, totally over 50,000 people. For example a solar lamp can provide light for a family of 3 or 5 and generates savings because by purchasing it the individuals do not need to purchase kerosene or candles. We also track the number of technologies sold, as well us the revenue generated for our entrepreneurs. There are other benefits which are a bit more difficult to track such as health improvements as well as productivity."," To date our NEI  is over 1 million USD and we have direct contact with over 50,000 people. We have sold 9,000 lamps, over 280 cookstove, over 35 water filters, and over 1000 eye glasses.","We hope to provide access to an additional 1,000 lamps for the community, provide 50 households access to improved cookstoves, 5,000 people access to clean water options, and 500 glasses to those without vision care. The NEI would be over US$ 150K.",Yes,,We have created empowerment metrics to measure the level of empowerment among the community members we work with. It is a series of metrics that we measure in the following order: 1. Awareness 2. Personal Knowledge 3. Action 4. Usage and Satisfaction 5. Direct Empowerment  6. Catalyzing Empowerment,"We work in 13 communities spreading awareness about the benefits of the technologies that we sell and conduct campaigns for community members to reflect on their usage. We have sold over 10,000 products which indicates action taken, and have a 90% net promoter score which indicates that clients are satisfied with the product and service. We have directly empowered those who purchased the product, and assuming the average household is of 5 people, our we have impacted over 50,000 people.","We plan to continue to conduct awareness campaigns in the 13 communities we work in the northeast and provide over 6,000 people with technology solutions, empowering approximately 30,000 individuals in the region. ",2500,"We define the clients served and impacted based on those who have acquired a technological solution and the average household of 5 persons that are receiving a direct benefit. For example, if a community member purchases a solar light, herself, partner, and children will get use out of the light.

Also, the lack of infrastructure for post-harvest handling and processing and the limited of access to high-value markets have prevented farmers from reaping fair prices.","Our business model involves four activities to address the pain points of the smallholder cacao farmer as follows: 1) Transfer technical knowledge to farmers in crop management, 2) facilitate farmers access to financing, 3) operate cacao post-harvest centers to ensure consistent product quality, and 4) commercialize FFC in the specialty segment. By commercializing FFC beans, Impulsa will transfer higher prices to farmers while building a robust profitability structure for the business.","Operations: We operate in Colombia in the Boyacá and Meta departments where the two farmer associations we are working with are located.
 Market: We target the finest chocolate producers worldwide.

Living in this waste is an environmental, economic and health disaster. Cities, like Nairobi, are struggling to address this in rapidly expanding urban slums where 90% of the sludge is being dumped untreated into waterways.","Sanergy builds healthy, prosperous communities by making safe sanitation, accessible and affordable for everyone, forever - starting with the urban slums of Nairobi, Kenya. We build a network of hygienic high-quality, low-cost “Fresh Life Toilets” (FLTs) in urban slums, safely collect the waste from the communities and treat and convert it into useful end-products. Our system-based approach results in residents of urban slums living in cleaner communities, leading healthier and more productive lives.","Our franchise network of container-based sanitation facilities are operated by local residents, Fresh Life Operators (FLOs), who operate them, either as small businesses or as a value-add service to their customers (such as tenants in the residential context or students at schools). We provide on-going marketing, business and maintenance support – empowering operators and ensuring toilets stay clean and safe for the residents of Mukuru and Mathare slums, two of the largest slums in Nairobi.","We go beyond simply providing access to toilets and build a full value chain approach that guarantees the containment, emptying, transport, treatment, and reuse or disposal of tons of sludge produced daily. Our innovative approach creates a financially sustainable urban safe sanitation system, replicable across the emerging market cities experiencing similar urban sanitation crises.","We are financially supported by donors, corporate and family foundations in multi-year partnerships to achieve significant efficiencies across the value chain, fund R&D, and grow our team’s capacity and knowledge. We have also received unprecedented endorsements from the Kenyan Ministries of Health, Environment and Education. We regularly and positively engage over 200 government officials from the community to national levels and our work is supported by organizations such as the World Bank and DFID.","The main challenge is to operate in a dynamic, informal environment marked by land insecurity. We mitigate this risk with a systematic land review to ensure proper land access and support of local authorities before installing FLTs. With this loan we foresee a forex risk given that our clients pay us in local currency.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/3726748617162695544/Sanergy-Growth-Plan-2017-2019_5-pager.pdf,46,"In the current strategy, our clients buy a franchised toilet structure from us and pay an annual service fee for waste collection. Our clients access loans to finance the toilet structure. Beginning Q3 2017 we will adopt a fee-for-service model, which entails an open lease of the toilet structure and focuses on clients paying for waste collection service: We have had a successful pilot of the model in Mathare for nearly a year. ",Our clients take on average about 30 days to settle invoices,"Our major purchase items relate to installation of the toilets: These include pre-fabricated toilet walls, roofing and doors. Other purchase items are the services associated with installation of toilets such as logistics and branding. We have a service contract with our related company, Sanergy Limited, whereby they handle all our installations at an agreed fee. We settle accounts whereby with the related company on a monthly basis.","We pay our biggest supplier, Sanergy Limited within 30 days of invoice. We operate on cash basis for most of other business requirements.","We determine sustainability through measuring cost effectiveness of our models in terms of overall cost per person per year. It measures our efficiency to remove waste all the way down the waste value chain, from the slum resident using our toilet, to the re-user, converting the waste into valuable end-products. Thanks to this indicator, we are able to monitor the contribution of all actors of the value chain in the provision of our sanitation solution. It is also an appropriate metric when discussing  potential public-private partnerships with government, which we are targeting as a means from massive scale.","With our model, it costs $22.55 to provide safe and hygienic sanitation per person per year in urban slums, in contrast to $55.77/person/year for sewered sanitation. Of this $22.55, $3.21 is covered by community investment, $8.04 is covered by re-use markets — partners treating and converting the waste into end-products — and $11.30 is covered through public funds (this is, at present, covered by donors).",Our objective is to reach a cost of $10/person/year for the public sector by the end of 2019 through more efficient operations and greater density. Achieving reduction in this metric makes our model compelling to governments looking to invest in cost-efficient models to solve the sanitation crisis and provide safe sanitation solutions for their residents.,No,,,,,50000,"As of June 2017, we have successfully launched 1,086 FLTs operated by 568 FLOs.

But almost all live in poverty. They lack access to high quality inputs, technical training and agricultural extension services, which prevents them from maximizing their production and securing their livelihood. The problem lies primarily in poor quality inputs – counterfeit seeds, fertilizers and animal feeds – which impact the quality of produce.","By providing smallholders access to genuine, high-quality products, and technical training, we positively impact their produce quality, yield and income. We source directly from manufacturers and manage all logistics to retail shops, which are modern open-format and staffed by knowledgeable professionals. We establish demonstration plots that serve as learning fields for the entire community. Our agronomists and veterinarians host clinics to diagnose animal and crop diseases and our suppliers sponsor product promotions and demonstration sessions.

Distribution is largely fragmented among many informal distributors and retail locations; as the trade modernizes Farm Shop will be well positioned to gain market share.,"We provide more value to smallholder farmers than the status-quo agro-dealers:

We also have special academic and other partnerships with universities in Canada, US, and UK; Ashoka; McKinsey; Aga Khan Foundation Canada; and others.","Our major risks are franchisee credit quality and supply chain risks.

Despite increased global access to clean water, 2,000 children die everyday from waterbourne disease. This is because access is only the first step to impacting health - water also needs to be safely stored and then drank exclusively. This is difficult to achieve in villages where poor hygiene makes it easy for water to get re-contaminated and surface water is convenient for busy farmers.","Saha partners with entrepreneurial women in rural villages and sets them up with a profitable chlorinating business that provides clean water that all can afford. We provide simple water treatment technology to a village, distribute safe water storage containers to every family, mentor the entrepreneurs and monitor the business for ten years. The water is affordable for even the very poor and the business sits right in the middle of the village.","Saha works in rural villages in the Northern Region of Ghana. In this area, 800,000 people currently live without access to safe drinking water and 25% of children under five are suffering from diarrheal disease at any given time. Families in this area survive off sustenance farming and live on less than $2 per day.","Unlike other water kiosk models, or well-drilling organizations, Saha focuses on impact, not access. Our goal is for people to drink clean water, not just buy it. Over 30% of water projects in developing countries fail, but Saha has opened 100 water businesses in Ghana and every one of them is still in operation today.","Saha has four main revenue sources – our Global Leadership Program (GLP), individual donors, corporate sponsors, and foundations. The GLP is earned revenue in the form of program fees.","The major risk is recruitment of volunteers for our Global Leadership Program. While our projections are based on 6 years of data, there is always a risk that we will not be able to secure volunteers for this program, whose program fees account for half of our revenue. 
 ",,,7,"Saha recruits volunteers for our program through university partnerships. We have over 2,000 professors, admins, and student leaders who share information about the Global Leadership Program and Saha's work. We host weekly webinars where potential volunteers can connect with or team.

We are piloting one such partnership with Virginia Tech this summer.",90,"Saha purchases the equipment needed to build a water treatment center (4 plastic tanks and a metal stand), from established vendors in Tamale. Our entrepreneurs can buy the chlorine they need from Saha (we purchase it from a local vendors in Ghana), but they can also go directly to the vendor if needed. They also use a product called alum to treat the water. The alum is available at the small village markets.",30,The most important social impact metric that we currently track is usage/adoption – how many people consistently have water from a Saha Business in their home.,"Our average adoption rate is 75%. 48,174 people have access to Saha water and 36,130 people are consistently drinking Saha water.","This loan will directly enable us to open 13 new water businesses, which we have planned for January 2018. These businesses will serve 5,200 people. With our current 75% adoption rate, 3,900 of those people will consistently drink clean, Saha water. Over the next two years, our anticipated total impact is 55,330 people. We are also constantly striving to increase our adoption rate through new programs in our communities. We will not open a new water business unless we have the funding to perform follow-up visits for 10 years. During these visits, we collect data on our adoption rate, test water quality, but also implement programs to increase our impact. Our goal is 100% adoption. Since our businesses stay open, we have the potential to impact everyone in the community.

We have a letter from theRIS confirming the name change. I have attached it, as well as our documents from the MA attorney general's office.
 
 Even though Saha Global is a non-profit, the water businesses that we establish in our partner communities are for-profit, social enterprises. We donate about $1,500 worth of materials to launch the business, but after opening day, all expenses are covered by the revenue from selling drinking water. The cost to treat 20L of water is 3 Ghana peswas (approx. 0.007 USD). The women entrepreneurs sell 20L of water for 10-20 Ghana peswas (0.02 - 0.05 USD). The women use their profits to pay themselves for their time and to save for long-term maintenance costs. This initial subsidies allows the entrepreneurs to keep their price low enough that the poor can afford while still capturing the sustainability benefits of being a social enterprise.
 
 Even though Saha does not collect any revenue from the sale of water at our water businesses, we do have earned revenue through our Global Leadership Program (GLP). The GLP program's revenue model essentially functions like a registration fee but it is structured as a donation so that Saha can be a fiscal agent that allows volunteers to fundraise as a charitable donation.  The proposed loan would function as a bridge loan until our winter 2018 GLP revenue comes due and it is further backed up by Foundation funding under an existing conditional commitment.",

But the micro-entrepreneurs who produce most of Kenya’s furniture face challenges that stifle their competitiveness -- imports are gaining market share, and consumers feel the local industry offers poor value.  Limited capital and poor quality supplies are the main barriers to their success.","Moko produces and sources tailored furniture-making materials which offer quality and affordability. Example innovative offering--low-cost, eco-cushions made from recycled European foam.
 
 Essential services for micro-enterpreneurs: trade credit allows inventory expansion and sales growth; sharing consumer market research helps improve service and efficiently invest limited resources. 
 
 Moko streamlines the supply chain with modern sourcing and logistics techniques, sourcing materials worldwide and distributing products to every corner of Kenya – reliably and affordably.","Kenya’s furniture industry is large and fractured.  Every town has its furniture “district” – micro-entrepreneurs along the roadside with their pieces on display.  This is how most furniture for BOP customers is sold.  Materials used to make furniture – which make up to 80% of its value – are distributed from Nairobi, mainly by informal means.  They are supplied by a variety of local importers and manufacturers.","Moko’s competitors focus on a narrow range of products, often targeting multiple markets and industries.  Moko is unique in targeting the furniture industry and its micro-entrepreneurs exclusively and holistically.  The company is the first to offer the full range of products and support services furniture entrepreneurs need to successfully run and grow their businesses.","Moko has built a partnership network of 160 informal furniture material retailers nationwide.  The company leverages this network to reach 5,600 micro-entrepreneurs and employees.  The company has grown to this level of success and achieved profitability through personal investment of the founders and other individuals who support the company’s goals.","Credit – In order to best serve micro-entrepreneurs, Moko extends credit to its customers.  While the company’s screening system keeps nonpayment below 1%, this is a continuous risk which must be managed.
 
 Political -  The market for non-essential products such as furniture is more prone to volatility at times of political uncertainty.",,,40,"Given the fractured and informal nature of Moko’s industry, the company reaches customers through direct in-person prospecting and contact.  Customer Engagement Officers manage particular regions and clusters of customers, developing a deep understanding of their market.  Moko’s products are distributed directly by the company and through a partnership with a nationwide bulk delivery service.",30-35,"Sourcing is critical to Moko’s business model, for both contract-manufactured goods and raw materials for in-house production.  Over time, the company has developed a network of a dozen international partners who have proven their ability to meet Moko’s expectations.

Highland Ave,Suite 210,Pittsburgh,PA,15206,United States,,,,,,,2011,Multiple shareholders,"Developing countries often suffer from two problems: an abundance of both poverty and trash. In these situations, the pervasiveness of poverty is simply the result of a lack of good, dignified jobs. Similarly, the abundance of trash is a result of a lack of infrastructure and institutions that can safely and responsibly dispose of or recycle it. Thread seeks to remedy both of these problems by transforming waste into high performance, purpose-filled fabric.","Thread has purchased 1.8M pounds of plastic from developing nations (currently Haiti and Honduras) and transforms it into jobs and fabric. We do this by purchasing plastic bottles that are responsibly collected and processed by over 3,800 Haitians and Hondurans. We then turn that material into purpose filled polyester (or polyester-blended) fabric, which is sold to apparel brands seeking a traceable, responsible, source material.","Currently, Thread is concentrated on selling fabric to apparel and footwear companies, which comprise a $200B+ market in the United States. Thread has an aggressive goal and sales strategy of 25 leading apparel and footwear brands utilizing our material in their production as a matter of course in the next two years.","Recycled clothing already exists, but Thread is able to leverage our uniquely human story of transparency and job creation from the First Mile of our supply chain to help apparel brands sell more clothes. Competitors often have no idea where their materials come from and simply market the fact that their product is recycled.","Currently, Timberland is Thread’s biggest customer. Last fall Thread, HP, and Timberland made a commitment through the Clinton Global Initiative to address child labor at the collection level in recycling in the Truitier landfill in Port au Prince, Haiti. Thread received Series A Venture Capital investment lead by Draper Triangle in 2015. In addition to CGI, Thread is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and Recycled Polyester working groups through the Textile Exchange.","Recycled plastic is a commodity. As a result its value often fluctuates in correlation with the price of oil. Haiti is also vulnerable to natural disasters. These factors can result in risk of loan repayment from our suppliers, but based on the success of our existing loan program, we can mitigate these risks.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/361773143401931103/Thread%20Business%20Model%20113016.xls,16.5,,30 days,,30 days,Income opportunities supported,"3,845 income opportunities supported since 2012 (1,345 in Haiti and 2,500 in Honduras)","10,000 income opportunities",Yes,,Pounds of plastic exported as valuable material,"1,852,687 lbs since 2012","1,000,000 lbs per year",,"One income opportunity is approximately equal to 10,000 bottles collected in the supply chain.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/kivadsi/62525934841965/361773143401931103/Thread_ImpactReport_2016%20v4.pdf,"$646,858",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$0,Self; Staff; Family and Friends; Individual Investors; Investment Funds,500,"Thread currently has a marketing reach of over 25,000 people on social networks alone.

 Ian founded both Team Tassy & Thread in 2010 in the wake of the Haiti earthquake. Team Tassy places the poor into jobs. Thread takes trash from poor neighborhoods & turns it into fabric. They sell the fabric to apparel and accessories brands trying to get more authentic, transparent, and responsible. Both organizations work together under the same core philosophy: the biggest problem we face as a species is multidimensional poverty; to end it, we need to invest in the poor to create as many dignified, sustainable jobs as possible. To date, Team Tassy has engaged almost 500 Haitians, preparing them and their families for employment. Thread has shipped nearly 30,000,000 plastic bottles out of Haiti and Honduras to eventually be processed into fabric & turned into finished goods and jobs.
 
 Ian is a 2013 University of Pittsburgh Johnson Institute for Responsible Leadership Awardee. He is a 2013 Dignity and Respect Champion. He is also a 2016 Unreasonable Impact Fellow. He has spoken about Thread's work with the poor for TEDx, One Young World, and Harvard Business School, and his work has been featured in Fast Company, Atlantic, the Guardian, and the Huffington Post.  He is an ultramarathoner, and in Feb 2015 founded and participated in the first Run Across Haiti, which has raised over $300,000 to date for Team Tassy’s work in Haiti. Ian lives in Brooklyn, NY with his wife, Raashi. They both believe that ending poverty is possible by the time they have grandchildren.

Many of them do not have electricity access at school, work or at the hospital either. This lack of power effects all aspects of many Tanzanian's lives and thus their health, education opportunities, productivity and access to development are severely hindered as a result.","Sikubora’s solution to this problem is the design, sale, install, service and financing of top tier solar home systems that are designed to be upgraded as the customer’s power needs grow and change over time. We partner with Arusha Technical College to source qualified electrical engineers that undergo rigorous training in solar install as well as sales and marketing.

","Simusolar provides a package that includes productive equipment and a stand-alone power source for off-grid applications, financed to make the package affordable and immediately beneficial (aka. cash flow positive) to customers.","We operate in the Lake Zone of Tanzania with plans to grow countrywide and regionally in a market we estimate to be over $3bn.  Over the next five years, we will serve over 75,000 customers, less than 1% of the regional market.  We reach customers through direct sales, introduced sales (coops), agents, and distributors (where we provide product and payment collection).  In a given region, we assume we can serve approximately 5% of the market.","Our solution is superior to the substitutes because of the financing (affordability), economics (cheaper than a fossil fuel), convenience (turnkey nature of systems), and reliability.  Relative to off-grid regional peers, we are the only one offering productive systems.  For systems that do overlap, our distribution model is distinct as we leverage existing channels and partners.","Having worked in the region for over 9 years through a non-profit entity (also led by Marianne), our team has regional relationships that aided initial pilot sales.  In terms of funders, the DOEN Foundation was critical in launching our pilot through a combined grant and PRI.  SNV’s results based finance has also provided incentives for reaching the most rural audience. Being part of GOGLA and  regional alliances, we benefit from support on regulatory policy issues.","One major risk is currency, as current funding markets are in the US and EU.  On the liability side, we are developing local funding relationships to complement our fundraising, likely accessible in Q1 2018.  On the asset side, we are increasing the short-term financing share of our portfolio to reduce the exposure.

A few households keep rabbits for food too. Out of these households, only 5% or below keep them as a business, thus restricting availability of indigenous chicken and rabbit meat products to the increasing urban population. This is limiting expansion of the available indigenous white meat choices as well as aiding in promoting food insecurity and socioeconomic disempowerment.","Farm Share Kenya Ltd is a start up ‘for profit’ social enterprise venturing in agribusiness. The enterprise’s vision is empowered youth and women enjoying improved livelihoods through inclusive business. We organize youth and women into groups, build their capacity in indigenous chicken and rabbit farming and contract them as our primary suppliers of mature chicken and rabbits. We buy from them, carry out all value addition processes, market and distribute to consumer outlets in Nairobi.","Recent studies show that the demand for indigenous chicken products is increasing in Nairobi. There is no commercial meat processing company dealing in indigenous chicken and rabbits, meaning that the demand will continue to grow in the next 5 years. Distribution channels vary from meat distributors, meat traders, butcheries, hotels, restaurants, and supermarkets with concentration in towns and urban areas. Major competitors include exotic poultry processors Kenchic, Farmers, Choice, SMEs with technology being major barrier.","Farm Share works with contracted youth and women farmer groups to ensure sustainable supply of mature indigenous chicken and rabbits for processing, marketing and distribution. This strategy ensures quality, traceability, and customer trust. Our control of the entire value chain ensures high quality products and facilitates quick responses to any gaps identified therein.","Our main customers are hotels and restaurants. We are developing a marketing strategy to increase our market share and establish marketing relationships, with hotels and restaurants being our target market. We do not have investors in our business yet, but we are on the lookout and open to discussions. We are members of Kenya Agribusiness and Agroindustry Alliance and Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition's Community of Practice. We collaborate with County and National governments.","The major risks associated with the business model and the loan includes:
 i. Few youth and women willing to enroll for contract farming
 ii. Delayed payment from our customers
 iii. Low quality products due to low grade equipment
 iv. Low meat processing technology. 
 v. High groups' training allowances.

Through local production and cost-effective transport, dloHaiti sells its water at 1/3 of the comparable product and 20% less than the lowest market price for treated water.","DloHaiti  operates in rural and peri-urban areas outside of the main cities in Haiti.  These areas lack basic infrastructure and potable water and reliable energy. Over 6 million people live in these areas, spending over $100 million each year to have clean water.","The majority of Haitians get their drinking water from trucks, making water expensive and supply unreliable with low water quality.  DloHaiti produces water where consumers consume it and distribute it more cost effectively, thereby reducing the price consumers pay and making it more available in areas that are difficult to serve by trucks.","We are funded by the IFC (World Bank Group), FMO (Dutch development bank), Leopard Capital (venture fund), and other private investors.  DloHaiti has also received funding from business innovation and entrepreneurship grants supported by USAID, DFID, CIDA, and IDB.  80% of dloHaiti customers live on less than $3/day.

However, development of the dairy value chain has been hindered by serious challenges and gaps related to smallholder milk yields/quality, processing quality, etc. Investments in improving yields and quality are useless (actually detrimental) unless combined with increased demand for milk from commercial processors willing to pay for quality milk.","Masaka Creamery works directly with smallholder dairy farmers, cooperatives and MCCs to produce high quality milk for the production of quality cultured products.

 We make our products affordable to the base of the pyramid through strategic partnerships with micro-finance institutions, community banks and through corporate social responsibility programmes.","Our cookstoves provide up to 70% reduction in fuel when compared against traditional cookstoves. This translates to approximately $3 USD per week cost saving to a poor family. Our solar lighting solutions can save between $3-9 USD per week in reduced kerosene expenditure.
 
 Since October 2013 we have distributed approx 100,000 units (combined cookstoves and lights) which will collectively save some of the poorest families in Kenya over $38 MM USD in reduced fuel costs.","We believe that by replicating our strategic partnerships model in Kenya we can realize success in Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda very quickly. There are approximately 28 million households across East Africa that could be classed as within our target market; currently either cooking or lighting with primary fuels.
 
 Since operations began we have achieved cumulative revenues of $3 MM USD. Between 2017-2019 we are expecting to achieve further revenues of $5.2 MM USD.","We are a very lean organisation compared to our competitors. We have a small workforce and low cost base meaning that we are currently operating profitably. By forming strategic partnerships we can focus on what we do best - product development.

We have received some grant monies from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves in order to pursue specific projects and initiatives.","The principle risk is the unpredictability of government decisions across the EAC region.

Most of the IT training institutions are only centers in urban areas thus leaving no opportunity for rural youth to access IT education. The cost of IT training is too high making it unaffordable by the rural youth.Additionally youth unemployment is on the rise especially for the rural youth who are highly unskilled and with no essential IT skills.,"We provide mobile IT training that runs from village to village. Our key objective is mainly; Making youth employable by equipping them with the IT skill. To achieve this we camp in a village for 1 month during which we provide flexible 3 hour learning from 8am to 8pm. With this model we are able to train an average 100 youth per village.To remain sustainable and profitable we charge our students KES 1,500",We operate in rural villages in Kenya and our target market is Youth and other populations living there. with our mobile model our market is always available and sometimes we do repeat trainings in one village due to number of youth interested in our training.,Our competitors are mainly colleges and universities who are stationed in urban areas and at the same time stationery. However our key advantage lies on our mobility and being able to reach rural populations.With our portable computer lab setups we easily integrate and deliver our program in the villages.,"Currently we are working closely with county and national governments who are supporting youth in making payments. On the other side we are working closely with Ashoka who have been providing a stipend for the CEO thus finding more time to invest time in the business. Ashoka also provides networks and opportunities to share our work. 
 
 We have received Investment from Social capital Foundation a connection by GSBI program at Santa Clara.","The main risk in our model is only out of unpredicted weather patterns that sometimes affect our mobility in the villages due to poor road networks thus potentially can delay realization of planned activities on time.
 
 Secondly there is a potential delay whenever government commits to pay for the youth due to government policy. ",,,27,"Currently we are running 10 labs per month with a spare lab for replacement of equipment and unplanned trainings. With the 10 labs we are training an average 1,000 youth every month. translating to KES 1,500,000 per month. 
 
 Our plan is to grow the number of labs to 20 with which we would be in a position to double our sales as well as our profits.",1 month when the students pay for themselves and 3 months when the government pays for them,"We are importing all our computers from Dubai mainly get good used laptops from Europe.

VITALITE estimates the off-grid population in Zambia to be in excess of 2,350,000 households. We are trying to solve energy poverty in Zambia while at teh same time reducing IAP and environmental degradation (deforestation/carbon emissions) resulting from the energy status quo  in Zambia.","To address, VITALITE is developing a robust network of SME/entrepreneur distributors and agents across Zambia to distribute modern, renewable energy products. VITALITE has launched Zambia’s first Pay  As You Go Solar Home System offering which allows customers pay the loan for the system off over up to 24 months, ultimately owning it. If the customer does not repay the loan using mobile money options, our technology will shut off the system’s ability to provide power.","VITALITE currently operates with five rural-focused hubs and five peri-urban outlets.  Scale-up plans involve establishing an additional 16 rural hubs by 2018, covering existing Lusaka, Eastern, Central, Western, Copperbelt, and Muchinga Provinces. The locations are targeted based on logistical priorities (efficiency of distribution), the presence of distribution partners, market size and other demographic factors. Districts which the first 20 hubs can service cover 50% of the rural population in Zambia – almost 5 million people.","VITALITE has numerous competitive advantages including:

Nearly 4 billion trees worldwide are cut down each year for paper products. Recovered fibers are playing an important roll in reducing this numbers.
 Recovered fibers will not only grow the economy, but will also lower the cost production and have a huge environmental impact.
 ","More than 76% of paper mills rely on recovered fibers to produce different products (office paper, tissue, newsprint) Not only does it lower the production cost but it also has a tremendous environmental benefit and energy savings.
 
 There are millions of tons of paper in mexico that are not being recovered. Amacalli wants to grow and strategically open recycling plants through out mexico to take advantage of the potential market which is being poorly approached.","Currently Amacalli has 3 plants (Two in Mexico city and one in Guadalajara). Collecting fibers basically from central and south east mexico.
 Mexico generates 86,000 tons of waste per day, today only 11% of that is being recovered. There is a potential market of 3 billion dollars and a projected growth of 10% annually.","We have been in the market for over ten years, Amacalli has very good connections with the paper mills (The owners of Amacalli know the owners of the paper mills) and suppliers. Amacalli´s product is based in quality.

In response to a low purchasing power, Bonergie offers the opportunity to buy all products on a credit base with the model pay-to-own. The customers pay a small down payment and pay the rest over a period of 1-3 years.","Bonergie has 4 regional offices. We have a direct and indirect Sales approach.
